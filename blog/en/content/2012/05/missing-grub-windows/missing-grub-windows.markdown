I came across this problem after I installed both Debian and Windows 7 system on my laptop.
After searching online, I found a solution to this problem. 
1. Open /etc/default/grub as root user and make sure the following line is somewhere in the file and uncommented:

        GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false

2. Run command `update-grub2` and then reboot your computer.

This solution is not just for Windows and Linux dual boot. 
It is also for dual/multiple Linux operating systems boot.
