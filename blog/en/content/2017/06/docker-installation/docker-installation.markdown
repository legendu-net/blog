## Install Docker in Other Operating Systems

Please refer to the offical Docker doc [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
on instruction to install Docker in other operating systems.

Configure your docker following instructions in the section 
[Configure Docker](http://www.legendu.net/en/blog/docker-installation/#configure-docker)
.

## Configure Docker 

By default,
the `docker` command requires `sudo` previlage to run
which is a little hassle since you have to type `sudo` every time 
and type your password for `sudo`.
It is suggested that you add yourself into the `docker` group
so that you can run the `docker` command without `sudo`.

    :::bash
    sudo gpasswd -a $(whoami) docker
    newgrp docker

The command `newgrp docker` makes the group `docker` take effect.
You can confirm by issuing the `id` command.
If for whatever reason the group `docker` does not take effect,
logout and then login again to make the group `docker` in effect.
