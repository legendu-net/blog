0. Unlike Teradata SQL, 
    a `select` statement in Oracle must have the `from` keyword. 
    The `dual` table can be used if you do not really want to select from a table.

        :::sql
        select 'example' from dual

1. insert multiple records/tuples into a table/tables

        :::sql
        insert all
        into t1(f1, f2) values (v1, v2)
        into t1(f1, f2) values (v3, v4)
        into t2(n1, n2) values (w1, w2)
        select * from t1;

    Note that you must issue a `select` clause at the end.
    Fields declaration can be omitted. 

2. Show user tables

    ::sql
    select * FROM user_tables;

3. rownum vs rownumber() over() 

3. how to drop if exists?

4. it's strange that I cannot insert multiple records into an empty table!
    be careful! you previous conclusion about fields might be wrong!

## Data Type

1. `varchar` is reserved by Oracle to support distinction 
    between NULL and empty string in future, 
    as ANSI standard prescribes.
    `varchar2` does not distinguish between a NULL and empty string, 
    and never will.
    If you rely on empty string and NULL being the same thing, 
    you should use `varchar2`.

## Regular Expression

    :::sql
    select
        regexp_substr('Programming', '(\w).*?\1', 1, 1, 'i')
    from
        dual
    ;

## Trick and Traps

it seems that {} in /* ... */ causes issues ...
