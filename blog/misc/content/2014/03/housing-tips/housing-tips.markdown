## Rent an Apartment

### Fees 

#### Utilities

1. Which utilities are included in the rent? Water, electric, trash, etc.

2. administration fee, application fee? I hate these fees.

2. Facing which direction?

- South is probably the best, especially the sun room

    
3. Internet

    - everyone claims their internet speed is fast
    - TV cable is usually faster than phone cable
    - ask for the name of internet supplier
    - Century Link is very bad, slow, limited services
    - Time Warner Cable is bad

### Facilities

    - Garage (In states where the winter is long and fierce, it is better get a garage.)

    - Laundry (Some apartments do not have a laundry room which is not convenient.)

    - Gym

    - Trash (get clear about where the trash can is and how to dispose trash)

    - sink (make sure it works, try it!, some sink might be clogged)

    - disposal (make sure there is disposal in the kitchen, some kitchen especially in cities don't have one)

## Appliances

- microwave

5. Floor
    - Generally higher floor is more quiet
    - higher floor is safer (security, flood, etc) and ususally cleaner (less bugs, etc.)

### Safety

1. Gated Community or Not

    - Gated is safer though not convenient for driving

## Furnitures

1. Coffee table, some can adjust height and convenient to put a laptop on it when watching TV


### Location

#### Quiet or Not

    - too close to noisy road?

    - too close to airport?

    - too close to a pulic facility?

    - big apartment? smaller is usually more quiet

    - higher level is usually more quiet

1. Is the house in or close to woods? If so, there might be many bugs especially in southern states.

2. If a house/apartment is too close to a highway/subway, 
it might be too noisy.
From my experience, 
two blocks (vertical distance) from the subway is acceptable.

3. Close to restaurant, shoppings, gym or not

4. How old is the apartment?

## Housing

1. whether it is a new house or not and facilitaties

2. radiation, etc., whether it is close to any high vol electric wires

3. whether it is close to a busy road, better not, if so, any stop signs

4. Safe or not, neighbours, etc.

## Misc

1. Never flush things except water down the sink. 
If you really have to flush things, 
use the toilet to flush it.
