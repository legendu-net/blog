[News from the Linux Mint development team](http://segfault.linuxmint.com/)
 

1. The Mint-X theme is a good one. 
Themes downloaded from internet might cause panel not working right.

2. For input method related issues, 
check the Input Method Tips post.

3. To go to the GUI session, 
press ctrl + alt + f8 instead of ctrl + alt + f7.
Generally speaking,
you want to try 
ctrl + alt + f6 
or
ctrl + alt + f8 
if
ctrl + alt + f7 
does not work on a Linux OS.

4. you can choose the fastest mirror (for both Main and Base) in "Software Source"
similarly as in Ubuntu.
