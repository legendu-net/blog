## fcitx

1. Add Pinyin method: add -> type in pinyin, type in chinese doesn't help 

## IBus

1. I suggest you use `CTRL` + `SPACE` as the switching hotkey,
    because it's the default hotkey for most input method engines.
    If the hotkey conflicts with other applications,
    you can quit IBus.

2. In Mint, it might not work after you install IBus.
    This is because some IBus components are missing.
    To fix the problem,
    goto System Settings -> Language -> Input Method
    Check the button right to "IBus". 
    If it says some IBus components are missing,
    then click the button "Install Missing IBus components".
