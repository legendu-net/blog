## Create a User 

Both `adduser` and `useradd` can be used to create a new user. 
`adduser` is interactive while `useradd` is non-interactive.
It is suggested that you use `useradd` in batch mode
and `adduser` in non-batch mode.

```sh
useradd -o -m -u -g -d 
groupadd -o -g 
```

## Group

Add a user to a group.
```sh
gpasswd -a user_name group_name
```

Get information about a group.
```sh
getent group group_name
getent group group_id
```
