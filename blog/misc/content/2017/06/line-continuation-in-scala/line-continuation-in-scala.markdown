Scala does not have a line continuation character.
It infers a semicolon always when:

1. an expression can end

2. The following (not whitespace) line begins not with a token that can start a statement

3. There are no unclosed ( or [ found before

Thus, 
to "delay" semicolon inference one can place a method call 
or the dot at the end of the line 
or place the dot at the beginning of the following line:

```scala
ConditionParser.
    parseSingleCondition("field=*value1*").
    description must equalTo("field should contain value1")

a +
b +
c
```

```scala
List(1,2,3)
    .map(_+1)
```

Wrap it in parentheses.
Note that wrap in curly braces doesn't work.
