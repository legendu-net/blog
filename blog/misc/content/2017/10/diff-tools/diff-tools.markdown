## General Tips

1. If 2 files are formatted differently,
  you can first format them and then check the differences between them.
  An extreme way is to get rid of all white spaces in the 2 files and then compare them.

        sed -i 's/ //g' file_1 file_2

## Command-line Tools

### git-diff

`git diff` is a generally useful command. 
It can not only show you the changes of files in side a Git repository
but can also be used to compare files/directories outside of a Git repository.

1. Show differences between 2 files.
    The option `--no-index` can be omitted if at least one of the two files is outside a Git repository.
    Output of `git diff` is colorized.

        git diff --no-index file_1 file_2

2. Show differences between 2 directories,
    which is similar to that of showing differences between 2 files.

        git diff --no-index dir_1 dir_2

### colordiff/diff

It is suggested that you use `colordiff` instead of `diff`
as `colordiff` colorizes the output of `diff`.
However, 
both `colordiff` and `diff` can be replaced by `git diff` as shown above.


### vimdiff

All of `git diff`, `colordiff` and `diff` show line-leve changes. 
`vimdiff` is great command-line tool that is able to show differences inside lines.
