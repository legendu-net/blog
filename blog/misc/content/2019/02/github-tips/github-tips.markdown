## Tips and Traps

1. Have at least 2 branches master and dev.
    Reserve the master branch for releasing purpose 
    and the dev banch for development.
    Protect the master branch on GitHub to require checks to pass before merging. 
    If it is only one person (yourself) developing on the project,
    do not require pull request review before merging. 
    Otherwise, if there are multiple people developing on the projects, 
    require pull request review (of at least 1 person) before merging.

2. CI workflows should be set up to make sure that the master branch is always valid.

3. A development (dev, daily, next, or whatever name) release should be made 
    when a push is made into the master branch. 
    An official tagged release should be made on creation of a new tag.
    A new tag should only be created on the lastest commit of the master branch!
