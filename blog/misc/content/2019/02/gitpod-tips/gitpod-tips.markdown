1. GitPod is a great web IDE for GitHub repositories.
    It supports both IDE and terminal environment via Docker,
    so a whole lot can be done if you are creative!

2. customized layers are supported

3. browser plugins are available for Chrome, Firefox, etc.

4. support installling VS Code extensions (*.vsix) by drag and drop.
    Installing from VS Code Marketplace is not supported at this time.
