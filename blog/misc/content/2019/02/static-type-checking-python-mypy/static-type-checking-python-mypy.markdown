--check-untyped-defs

You can use the option `--ignore-missing-imports` to disable the annoying error messages `No library stub file for module...`.
Please see the [issue](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/3905) for more details.

You can use `# type: ignore` to silence some errors.
Please see the [issue](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/500) for more details.
