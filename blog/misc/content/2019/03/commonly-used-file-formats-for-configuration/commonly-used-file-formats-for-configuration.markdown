It seems that many people recommend TOML over JSON and YAML.

## JSON

## [jsonnet](https://github.com/google/jsonnet)
[jsonnet](https://github.com/google/jsonnet)
is the data templating language.

## [YAML](https://yaml.org/)

## [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml)

## XML

## [translate/translate](https://github.com/translate/translate)
