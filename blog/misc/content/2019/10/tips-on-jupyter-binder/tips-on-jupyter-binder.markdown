**
Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author.
Please read with your own judgement!
**


1. By default a Jupyter notebook server is shown. 
    You can manually switch to the JupyterLab server by changin `tree` to `lab?` in the URL.
    For more details, 
    please refer to 
    [binder-examples/jupyterlab](https://github.com/binder-examples/jupyterlab).

2. `sudo` is not supported.


3. Generally speaking, binder is good for temporary usage when you only need Python packages.
