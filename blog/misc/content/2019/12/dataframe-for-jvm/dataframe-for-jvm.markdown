## Spark DataFrame

Spark DataFrame is a great implementation of distributed DataFrame,
if you don't mind having dependency on Spark.
It can be used in a non-distributed way of course.
Spark DataFrame is mostly friendly for Scala (Spark/Scala) and Python (PySpark),
and can be used in Jupyter/Lab notebooks.

## pandas 

Via Python/Java interfaces (jpype, py4j or pyjnius).

## Tablesaw

Tablesaw is currently the most mature non-distributed DataFrame implementation for JVM languages.
However, 
its usability is still far behind Spark DataFrame and Python pandas DataFrame.


## [krangl](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/krangl)
krangl is a DataFrame implementation in Kotlin.
