1. Cross validation in scikit-learn supports pipeline in addition to vanilla models.
    Please refer to 
    [Cross Validation Pipeline](https://chrisalbon.com/machine_learning/model_evaluation/cross_validation_pipeline/)
    for more details.

3. [Label encoding](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing_targets.html#label-encoding)
    is an easy way to convert a categorical response/target variable to a numeric one and back to the raw value space.
    For transform of response/target varible in regression,
    please refer to [Transforming Target in Tegression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html#transforming-target-in-regression).
