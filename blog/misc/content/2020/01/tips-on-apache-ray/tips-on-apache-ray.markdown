## Deploy Apache Ray

Please refer to 
[Deploy Apache Ray](http://www.legendu.net/misc/blog/deploy-apache-ray/)
for details.

## Tutorials and Examples

[How to scale Python multiprocessing to a cluster with one line of code](https://medium.com/distributed-computing-with-ray/how-to-scale-python-multiprocessing-to-a-cluster-with-one-line-of-code-d19f242f60ff)
demonstrates how you can scale a Python multiprocess application 
to run on an Apache Ray cluster 
with only one line change of your code 
(change `import multiprocessing.Pool` to `ray.util.multiprocessing.Pool`).
Of course,
you have to export the environment variable `RAY_ADDRESS=auto` 
before running the Python code 
or you have to make an another line of change 
which is to change `Pool()` to `Pool(ray_address="auto")`.
For more details,
please refer to
[Distributed multiprocessing.Pool](https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/multiprocessing.html)
