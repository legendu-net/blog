Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses.

Nmap provides a number of features for probing computer networks, 
including host discovery and service and operating system detection. 
These features are extensible by scripts that provide more advanced service detection,[4] vulnerability detection,[4] and other features. 
Nmap can adapt to network conditions including latency and congestion during a scan.
