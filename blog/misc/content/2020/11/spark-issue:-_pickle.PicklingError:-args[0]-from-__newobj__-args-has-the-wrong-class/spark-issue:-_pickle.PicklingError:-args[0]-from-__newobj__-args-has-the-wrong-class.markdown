Please refer to
[Spark Issue: Task Not Serializable](http://www.legendu.net/misc/blog/spark-issue-task-not-serializable)
for a similar serialization issue in Spark/Scala.

## Symptom

## Cause

For example,
if you have the following import 

    from nltk.corpus import stopwords

then calling the following in UDF or pandas UDFs might cause this issue. 

    stopwords.words("english")

## Solution 

Simply move `stopwords.words("english")` out of UDFs and/or pandas UDFs to define a global variable.
