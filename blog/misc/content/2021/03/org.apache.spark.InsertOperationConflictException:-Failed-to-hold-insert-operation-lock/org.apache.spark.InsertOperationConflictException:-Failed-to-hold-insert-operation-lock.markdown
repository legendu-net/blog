## Symptom

org.apache.spark.InsertOperationConflictException: Failed to hold insert operation lock ...

## Cause

Multiple Spark applications attempts to write to the same directory at the same time.

## Solution

Resubmit your Spark application with a different output path 
or make sure that it is the only application writing to the output path.
