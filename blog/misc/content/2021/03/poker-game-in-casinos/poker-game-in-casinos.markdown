## Vegas

Best place for gambling games in the US.

## Washington

Max bet is 300 in non-tribals, 
500 on tribal casinos. 
There is a 4-bet cap (3 raises) in both types of rooms. 
Also non-tribals can have a max of 15 tables of any type. 
So if you go to a casino, as opposed to a card room, that spreads 5 pit games, they can spread, at most, 10 poker games.
