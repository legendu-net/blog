1. The option `pos=1` of the function `assign` refers to the global environment, 
    i.e., the user's workspace. 
    Containers in R are 1-based, 
    so it is easy to understand (and remember) that R use 1 to stand for the global enviroment (user's workspace).
    Notice that `..GlobalEnv` is a variable standing for the global environment and `globalenv()` returns the global environment,
    `pos=1` is equivalent to say `pos=.GlobalEnv` or `pos=globalenv()`.
    If you want to create a global variable in a function,
    you can use the function `assign` by specifying `pos=1` (or `pos=.GlobalEnv` or `pos=globalenv`).
    Another easier but less powerful way is to the `<<-` or `->>` to assign/create global variables. 
        
2. The function `new.env` creates a new environment. 
    If you want to source in some code 
    but would rather let the code in a new environment (so that the environment sourcing the code is not contaminated),
    you can use `source(path_to_file, local=new.env())`.

3. The function `emptyenv` returns an immutable empty environment. 
    The empty environment is not used to evaluate expressions or run code but rather to check whether nested environments end.
