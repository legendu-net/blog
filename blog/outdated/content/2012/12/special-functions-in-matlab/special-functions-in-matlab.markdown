1. `sin` calculates sine of arguments in radian 
while `sind` calculates sine of arguments in degrees; 
`asin` calculates inverse of sine resulting in radian 
while `asind` calculates inverse of sine resulting in degrees. 
Other triangular functions behave similarly.

2. The modified Bessel function of the first kind `$I_n(x)$` 
is implemented as `besseli` in MATLAB. 
Notice that for large value ` x`, `$I_n(x)$` is huge, 
so it is better to use scaled Bessel function for large `x`. 
To do this, you just need specify an extra argument for `besseli`. 
Notice that other kind of Bessel functions are also implemented in MATLAB.

3. Incomplete Beta function is implemented as `betainc` 
and incomplete Gamma function is implemented as `gammainc` in MATLAB.

4. The logarithm of Gamma function is implemented as `gammaln` 
and the logarithm of Beta function is implemented as `betaln` in MATLAB.

5. `cart2sph, cart2pol, pol2crt, sph2cart, hsv2rgb` and `rgb2hsv` can
transform coordinates between different coordinate systems.

6. `mfun` can help evaluate special mathematica functions numerically,
but you should be aware of the fact that the result return by
calling `mfun` is not as accurate as invoking these special function
directly in MATLAB, especially when a function is near its root and
its arguments are relatively large. Also `mfunlist` can list special
functions for use with `mfun`.
