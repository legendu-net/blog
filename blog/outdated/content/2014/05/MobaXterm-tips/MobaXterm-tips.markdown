Things under legendu.net/outdated are outdated technologies 
that the author does not plan to update any more. 
Please look for better alternatives.

1. MobaXterm uses a temporary folder as the home directory by default 
    and all data in the temporary home directory will be lost next time you run MobaXterm,
    so it is a good practice to set up a permanent folder 
    as your home directory before you use MobaXterm.
    It is suggested that you use the `My Documents` as the home directory for MobaXterm.

2. Commands in MobaXterm (based on BusyBox) have limited functionalities 
    compared to the same commands in Linux/Unix. 
    You probably need to modified you bash code in Linux/Unix 
    in order to run in MobaXterm.

3. Vim in MobaXterm is compiled without python support,
    so vim plugins (e.g., UltiSnips) requiring python might not work
    even if you can install python as a plugin in MobaXterm.

1. It is strange that rename is available on MobaXterm but you get no help doc for it. 
    There is no way for you to know it unless you accidently tried rename on MobaXterm.

2. You can copy Cygwin exe files to MobaXterm to extend its functionalities. 
    You can also use other existing programs in Windows, e.g., R. 
    However, 
    interactive programs (e.g., R) might not well as an error might cause the program to exit.

3. MobaXterm automatically adjust case which is convenient on Windows.

## Tools Not Available

1. at, cron

## Available

1. shutdown, rename (limit functionalities, different from rename in Linux), ssh

2. MobaXterm rename is indeed available, though no documentation available
