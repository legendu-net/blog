1. You can use the function `tidy_souce` in the R package `formatR`
to format R code.
```R
tidy_source('unformatted.r', file = 'formatted.r')
```
However, 
there is a bug in the package `formatR`.
For example, 
the `formatR` fails to work with the following code.
```R
if { # this is comment
    ...
}
```

2. Avoid changing the type of object.
