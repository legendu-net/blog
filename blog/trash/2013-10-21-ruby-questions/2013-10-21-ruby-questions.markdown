1. One of my program written in Ruby runs perfectly on 32 bit Ubuntu but not 64 bit Ubuntu. 
What's the problem? Is it caused by Ubuntu or by change of API in Ruby?

2. It seems that you can use "==" to compare whether two strings are equal in ruby. 
What if I want to compare whether the two strings are the same object or not? 

1. My ruby code for calculate phone bill works perfect on 32bit Ubuntu but does not work on my 64 bit Ubuntu. 
I'm not sure what is wrong. It is probably resulted from the "Actionmailer" package. 

2. How to remove ruby packages using gem?
