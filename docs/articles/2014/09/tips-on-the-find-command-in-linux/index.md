## Better Alternatives to `find`

There are some better alternatives to find.
The Python module `pathlib` is the most suitable one for relatively complex jobs.
`fd`, `ripgrep`, `fselect` and `osquery`
are other alternatives.

## Example Usages

### Search Files By Name

1. Find all files with the extension ".out" in the current directory and its subdirectory,
   and then make them executable.

   ```
    :::bash
    find . -type f -iname *.out -exec chmod +x '{}' \;
    # or you can use 
    find . -type f -iname *.out -print0 | xargs -0 chmod +x
   ```

1. Find files whose names contain "conflicted" and remove them.

   ```
    :::bash
    find . -iname '*conflicted*' -print0 | xargs -0 rm
   ```

1. Find Python scripts in the current directory recursively
   but ignore those under directories with the name `.ipynb_checkpoints`.

   ```
    :::bash
    find . -type f -iname '*.py' -not -path '*/.ipynb_checkpoints/*'
   ```

### Search Files by Size

1. Find files with 0 size and delete them.

   ```
    :::bash
    find /path/to/files -size 0 -ok -exec rm {} \;
    # or you can use
    find /path/to/files -size 0 -ok | xargs rm 
   ```

1. Find empty directories.

   ```
    :::bash
    find / -type d -empty
   ```

1. Find files greater than 1G.

   ```
    :::bash
    find . -xdev -type f -size +1G
   ```

1. First find files and then pass them to other commands is a very useful trick.
   For example,
   you can use the following command to find all R scripts containing the word `paste`.

   ```
    :::bash
    find . -type f -iname '*.r' | grep --color=auto paste
   ```

### Search Files by Time

1. Find files created with in 60 minutes.

   ```
    :::bash
    find . -cmin 60
   ```

1. Find files more than 30 days ago

   ```
    :::bash
    find . -ctime +30
   ```

1. Find file less than 30 days ago.

   ```
    :::bash
    find . -ctime -30
   ```

1. Find files that are exactly 30 days ago.

   ```
    :::bash
    find . -ctime 30
   ```

1. Find all files modified on the June 7, 2007 in the current directory.

   ```
    :::bash
    find . -type f -newermt 2007-06-07 ! -newermt 2007-06-08
   ```

1. Find all files accessed on the Sep 29, 2008 in the current directory.

   ```
    :::bash
    find . -type f -newerat 2008-09-29 ! -newerat 2008-09-30
   ```

1. Find files which had their permission changed on the same day.

   ```
    :::bash
    find . -type f -newerct 2008-09-29 ! -newerct 2008-09-30
   ```

### Search Files by Type

1. Find broken symbolic links.

   ```
    :::bash
    find . -xtype l
    # or
    find -L . -type l
   ```

1. Find executable files in current directory

   ```
    :::bash
    find .  -maxdepth 1 -type f -executable
   ```

1. Check file type of all files under the current directory.

   ```
    :::bash
    find . -type f | xargs file
   ```

### Search Files by User Permission

1. Find files that belong to a user but writable by its group or other people.

   ```
    :::bash
    find /path/to/file -user user1 -perm /022
   ```

   - `-perm mode`: File's permission bits are exactly mode (octal or symbolic).
   - `-perm -mode`: All of the permission bits mode are set for the file.
   - `-perm /mode`: Any of the permission bits mode are set for the file.

1. The following command finds all files that readable or writable by the group or (readable or writable) by others.

   ```
    :::bash
    find /path/to/file -user user1 -perm /066
   ```

1. The following command find all files that readable and writable by the group and (readable and writable) by others.

   ```
    :::bash
    find /path/to/file -user user1 -perm -066
   ```

1. The following command find all files that readable or writable by the group and (readable or writable) by others.

   ```
    :::bash
    find /path/to/file -user user1 -perm /060 -perm /006
   ```
