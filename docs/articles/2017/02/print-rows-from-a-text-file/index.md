It is suggested that you **use Python instead of Shell** to manipulate text files!

Please refer to
[Advanced Use of "head" and "tail"](advanced-use-of-head-and-tail)
on how to use `head` and `tail` for printing rows from a text file.
These 2 commands are convenient when you want to take head/tail rows.
If you want to take middle rows of a file,
better ways exists using `sed` and `awk`.

```bash
# print lines 10 to 20 using sed
sed -n '10,20p' filename
# print lines 10 to 20 using awk
awk 'NR >= 10 && NR <= 20' file_name
```

If you work with a very large file,
you make the `sed` command a little bit more efficient by quitting ealier.
For example,
the following command efficiently prints lines 10000000 to 10000020 of the file.

```bash
sed -n '10000000,10000020p; 10000021q' file_name
```

Thi way is faster than `awk` (but slower without the quitting early trick) on large files.
