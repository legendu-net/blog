**Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author. Please read with your own judgement!**

## Debugging

1. [pdb](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html)

[Goodbye Print, Hello Debugger! - Nina Zakharenko - Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AYIe-3cD-s)

## Unit Testing

1. When separate teams/people are developing different components in a big project
   and unit testing has to be written before other dependent components are ready,
   make sure that unit tests cover agreed interfaces.

1. Printing intermediate variables is the universal way (even inefficienty many times) for debugging.
   [PySnooper](https://github.com/cool-RR/PySnooper) is debugging tool
   based on the idea of printing intermediate varibles
   but is great improved over the plain `print` function
   and is both easy and fun to use.

1. `unitest` is the official unit testing tool in Python
   and thus has better support and integration with other tools generally speaking.
   However,
   `pytest` is more concise than `unittest` and makes unit testing more efficiency.
   `pytest` is also widely adopted.
   Please refer to
   [Write Unit Tests Using unittest in Python](write-unit-tests-using-unittest-in-python)
   and
   [Write Unit Tests Using PyTest in Python](write-unit-tests-using-pytest-in-python)
   for more details on how to use unittest and pytest.

## Doctest

## hypothesis

## [coverage](measure-python-code-coverage)

Please refer to
[coverage](measure-python-code-coverage)
for details.

## Mock and pytest Fixtures

## CICD

1. It is suggested that you leverage professional CICD tools such as GitHub Actions
   instead of
   [nox](tips-on-nox)
   or
   \[pre-commit\](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit] (Git hooks)
   for CICD.
   However,
   Git hooks can be useful for simple and fast local code formatting.

1. GitHub Actions seems to the best CICD (and more) tool for projects on GitHub.

## Travis CI

To setup Travis-CI on a github project, all you have to do is:

add a .travis.yml file at the root of your project
create an account at travis-ci.com and activate your project
The features you get are:

Travis will run your tests for every push made on your repo
Travis will run your tests on every pull request contributors will make

## Jenkins

Jenkins is another popular one.
