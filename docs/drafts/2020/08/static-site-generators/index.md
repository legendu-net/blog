`next export` allows you to export your Next.js application to static HTML,
which can be run standalone without the need of a Node.js server.
It is recommended to only use next export
if you don't need any of the unsupported features requiring a server.

## [hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo)

Hugo is a static HTML and CSS website generator written in Go.
It is optimized for speed, ease of use, and configurability.
Hugo takes a directory with content and templates and renders them into a full HTML website.

Hugo relies on Markdown files with front matter for metadata,
and you can run Hugo from any directory.
This works well for shared hosts and other systems where you don’t have a privileged account.

Hugo renders a typical website of moderate size in a fraction of a second.
A good rule of thumb is that each piece of content renders in around 1 millisecond.

Hugo is designed to work well for any kind of website including blogs, tumbles, and docs.

## [ABlog](https://github.com/sunpy/ablog)

[ABlog](https://github.com/sunpy/ablog)

is a Sphinx extension that provides a source parser for `*.ipynb` files.
Custom Sphinx directives are used to show Jupyter Notebook code cells
(and of course their results) in both HTML and LaTeX output.
Un-evaluated notebooks (i.e., notebooks without stored output cells)
will be automatically executed during the Sphinx build process.
