## Tips and Traps

1. You can use `sudo` without password in Linux and macOS when running GitHub Actions.

1. GitHub Actions supports [manual triggers with workflow_dispatch](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch/).
   Workflow parameters are supported in manually triggers.

1. `GITHUB_TOKEN` is an automatically generated secret
   that lets you make authenticated calls to the GitHub API in your workflow runs.
   Actions generates a new token for each job and expires the token when a job completes.
   `GITHUB_TOKEN` can also be used for the GitHub Action `peter-evans/create-pull-request` to create PRs automatically.
   However,
   GitHub bot is the owner of a PR created by the GitHub action
   [create-pull-request](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request) with `GITHUB_TOKEN`
   which might have issues triggering other pipelines listening to PR events.
   A simple solution to this problem is to manually create a repository secret (e.g., `GITHUBACTIONS`)
   and use it to autenticate the GitHub Action
   [create-pull-request](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request)
   .

1. Rust cannot be installed into a global location
   following instructions at
   [Install Rust Globally in Linux](install-rust-globally-in-linux)
   .
   This might because GitHub Actions VMs have restrictions on environemnt variables.
   You can still install Rust using root (via sudo)
   but this doesn't give you much priviledge
   as the root account in a GitHub Actions VM is restricted too.

1. Good practices for GitHub repository with GitHub Actions workflows:

   - Have 2 protected branches `main` and `dev`,
     where `main` is reserved for releasing
     and `dev` is reserved for development.
   - Fork the `dev` branch for development.
   - A PR from `dev` to `main` should be made
     when it is ready to release a new version.

## Runner Images

1. OS: ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macOS-latest

Please refer to
[runner-images](https://github.com/actions/runner-images)
for support OS images for VMs.

## Branch Matching

```
on:
push:
    branches:    
    - '*'         # matches every branch that doesn't contain a '/'
    - '*/*'       # matches every branch containing a single '/'
    - '**'        # matches every branch
    - '!master'   # excludes master
```
