**Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author. Please read with your own judgement!**

Please refer to
[Spark Issue: Task Not Serializable](spark-issue-task-not-serializable)
for a similar serialization issue in Spark/Scala.

## Symptom

## Cause

For example,
if you have the following import

```
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
```

then calling the following in UDF or pandas UDFs might cause this issue.

```
stopwords.words("english")
```

## Solution

Simply move `stopwords.words("english")` out of UDFs and/or pandas UDFs to define a global variable.
