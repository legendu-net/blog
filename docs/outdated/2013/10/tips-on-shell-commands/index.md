0. command-not-found - Suggest installation of packages in interactive bash sessions

1. nohup, disown

1. nautilus-open-terminal

## Configuration

https://github.com/thoughtbot/til/blob/master/bash/bash_profile_vs_bashrc.md#:~:text=bashrc%20is%20sourced%20on%20every,with%20the%20%2D%2Dlogin%20option.&text=bash_profile%20is%20great%20for%20commands%20that%20should%20run%20only%20once%20and%20

1. Debian does not read in the `.profile` file on start-up of X windows.
   To solve this problem,
   you can source in `.profile` in in the `.xsessionrc` file.
   Ubuntu and Mint does read in the `.profile` file on start-up of X windows.

1. You'd better use robust configuration files.
   If an error is encountered in the `.xsessionrc` file,
   the desktop environment might fail to start.

### Media

1. Empty CD tray, cannot eject by pressing the bussion,
   an interesting trick to eject CD: try to amount the CD eject the tray

## Cool Command

1. `~` is recognized as the home directory of the current user in shell only.
   You'd better not use it in other places.
   Whenever the home directory of the current user is needed,
   you can always use `$HOME` instead.

1. Check whether a system is 32 bit or 64 bit

   ```
    :::bash
    getconf LONG_BIT
   ```

1. all parameters: `$@` (what about `$*`?)

1. Be careful about `.` when using regular expressions (e.g., sed),
   this is really a general problem

1. the trick of "--" end of command after which only positional arguments are accepted

1. variable substituation makes things very interesting in shell,
   for example awk and so on ..., always be careful if you use "\$" and so on....

1. process of substitution \<() >(), pipe ...

1. variables defined in bash function won't polute the global environment
   and local make the variables visible only to the scope of the function

1. prefer dot rather than source for sourcing script,
   because source is only for bash

1. executable files:
   if in \$HOME/bin, prefer symbolic links,
   if for general uer, prefer to make a global copy,
   don't use symbolic link in /usr/bin pointing to your own files,
   you might change your file permissions and mess up the program

1. If an environment path contains spaces,
   you have to quote it with double/single quotations marks
   in order to make shell commands work correctly.

### top

3. top command
   Unit of the Time+ column: minutes:seconds.hundredths

### ls

7. `ls -d */` displays all directories in the current folder

1. `ls /home/*` in bash, don't use it, instead use `(/home/*)` directly

   ```
    ls -d "/home/dclong/btsync/backup/tbp_"*
   ```

   instead of

   ```
    ls -d "/home/dclong/btsync/backup/tbp_*"
   ```

   it seems to me that if you wildcard,
   then full names are returned, otherwise, short names are returned.

1. By default,
   the year for files older than 6 month are not displayed.
   You can force `ls` to show full time information by `ls -lh --full-time`.

### rsync

10. `rsync`, `/` at the end is important,
    this decides whether the folder is copy or its content is copied, unison is similar ...
    This is the same for some other commands like Amazon S3, etc.
    Also if you want to exclude an folder from `rsync`,
    you have to include the trailing slash.

### alias

25. it seems alias has lots of limitations ... only use single quotation mark,
    causes lots of problem
    YOU ACTUALLY CAN USE DOUBLE QUTOES

01. If you define an alias of a path (especially a Windows path in Cygwin, MobaXterm, etc.),
    you have to quote the path in commands, generally speaking.
    For example, if the alias of path you define is `p` (which contains spaces),
    you can use `cd "$p"` to change working directory to it.
    Note that you cannot omit the quotes.

## Filesystem

### cp

26. always use `cp` with `-i` option!

01. `cp -a` might not be a good idea sometimes,
    e.g., when in Cygwin/MobaXterm, because you might lose file permissions due to unmatch of users

01. Both cp and mv overwrite the destination file
    if is is already exists.
    cp does not overwrite existing destination directory
    but instead acts as merging contents of directories.
    mv refuses to rename a directory to a destination directory
    if the destination directory is not empty.

It is suggested that you use rsync as much as possible
as an alternative to cp.

```bash
# copy sub files/folders excluding hidden files/folders
cp a/* b
# copy sub files/folders including hidden files/folders
cp a/. b
```

### mv

5. always use interactive version of `mv` and `cp` ...
   and always use `trash` instead of `rm`

### du & dust

### grep & [ripgrep](the-ripgrep-command-is-a-better-alternative-to-the-find-command)

### ps & procs

### cat & [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)

`bat` is a much better alternative to `cat`.

### rm & [rip](https://github.com/nivekuil/rip)

`rm` is dangerous.
It is suggested that you use the `rip` command (implemented in Rust)
as much as possible.

1. Remove a file whose name starts with `--` and has special characters.

   ```
    rm ./'--exclude.!sync'
   ```

1. Get file name without extension.

   ```
    basename -s .txt f.txt
   ```

1. Create a temp file.

   ```
    mktemp -tu file.XXXXX
   ```

   `mktemp` is preferred over `tempfile`.

### gpasswd

6. `gpasswd` is great for adding and removing user to/from groups

   gpasswd -d user group

### type

27. `type fun_name` shows source code of bash functions or use `declare -f`
    `type command` path of command

### mount

10. check if a path is a mount point

    ```
    if [ $(stat -fc%t:%T "mnt/wd") != $(stat -fc%t:%T "mnt/wd/..") ]; then
        echo "mounted"; else echo "not mounted";
    fi
    ```

01. mount as normal user instead of root

    ```
    mount -o uid=dclong ...
    ```

### sudo

8. I think it's better to use sudo inside bash script
   instead of prefix sudo to script names to invoke them.
   The reason is that you use sudo only when needed.

1. sudo alias

   ```
    alias sudo='sudo '
   ```

the space is necessary

### real absolute path

19. realpath: absolute path

01. absolute path

```bash
readlink path
```

### random

1. Generate a random number.

   random 0 - 32767 uniform

### Power Management

14. Show battery/power information

    ```
    acpi -bi
    ```

## Administration

3. shutdown, poweroff, halt
   It seems these commands have different meanings on different Linux distributions.
   The actually case is really complicated.
   It depends on different Linux distributions and also the services running on laptops.
   If a service fails to stop,
   the shutdown process might freeze at the logo page.

   ```
    halt -p
   ```

   It is suggested that you always use the `poweroff` command to shutdown (and poweroff) your computer.
   You should close all programs before you logout or shutdown your computer.

1. to change time zone using command sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

1. `ssh -X` X11 forwarding, make it possible for you to use GUI applications on server

## Task

8. `at` command run in backgroud,
   so do not use it to do things that have to communicate with stdin stdout ...

## Archive

1. DO NOT USE the 7-zip format for backup purpose on Linux/Unix
   because 7-zip does not store the owner/group of the file.

1. difference between 7za and 7z?

## UI

5. use syndaemon -dti 0.5 to disable touchpad while typing.
   You have to have `Option SHMConfig "on"` or `Option SHMConfig "true"` in the synaptics configuration file.

1. Sometimes when you login into a server,
   it freezes after printing the welcome message.
   You can press `CTRL + C` to kill running process and it might help you bring the terminal back.

1. Linux release specific information

   ```
    lsb_release -a
   ```

   the lsb-release package

## Process

1. Use `Ctrl + Z` to pause a process and use `bg` to send it to background to run.
   Use `fg` to bring a background process to foreground.

1. `ldd --version` check glibc version

1. You can use `ps aux | grep -i user_id` to list your jobs
   and `kill -9 process_id` to kill a process.
   On platform Load Sharing Facility (LSF),
   you probably don't have access to `kill` unless are a privileged user.
   Instead of using `ps` and `kill`,
   you can use `bjobs` to show your jobs and `bkill process_id` to kill your process.

1. when defining alias,
   do not use tailing `/` in paths unless you have a good reason for that ...

1. file to check link cannot use trailing `/`

1. what have caused the blog difference issue?, line terminators

1. comm: make sure you don't screw up by invisible white spaces!!!,
   intersection/inner join, left join, right join (add keywords to your blog)

1. type of disk

   ```
   df -T
   ```

CPU Stats

## UUID in Bash

```bash
uuidgen
```

need the libuuid library which is part of `util-linux`

1. `id -un` is a better alternative than `whoami`.

## Timezone

Linux

```
cat /etc/timezone
```

Mac
