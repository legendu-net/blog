[Fish Shell](tips-on-the-fish-shell)
is preferred to Bash/Zsh.
The following content is for Bash/Zsh only.

1. A bash prompt can be editted in both Vi mode and Emacs mode.
   The default is Emacs mode.
   You can turn on the Vi mode by `set -o vi` in `.bashrc`.
   This will make all bash prompts be edited in a limited single-line Vi mode.

1. The `fc` command edits the last shell command (using `$EDITOR`) and then send it for execution.

1. The shortcut `ctrl+x` `ctrl+e`
   edits the current shell prompt using `$VISUAL` or `$EDITOR`.
   If you want to use neovim as the editor,
   add the following configuration into your shell configuration.

   ```
    export VISUAL=nvim
    export EDITOR=nvim
   ```

   This is the recommended way to edit shell prompts
   as it allows your the full power and flexibility of the Vim editor.
   For example,

   - You are not limited to single-line editing of a single command.

     - You can span a complicated command to multiple lines using `\`.
     - You can split a complicated command into multiple simpler commands on multiple lines.
       On quiting Vim,
       those commands will be run in sequential.

   - If you find that you need information from historical commands
     while editing a prompt,
     you can bring historical commands in using the following command in Vim.

     ```
       :r ! fc -ln -10
     ```

   Notice that the shortcut `ctrl+x` `ctrl+e`
   doesn't work out-of-the-box in the terminal in Visual Studio Code.

1. [fzf.history](https://github.com/legendu-net/icon/blob/dev/utils/data/bash-it/plugins/custom.plugins.bash#L124)
   allows you to search through shell command history,
   select one, editing it in `$EDITOR`,
   and then send the edited command for execution.
