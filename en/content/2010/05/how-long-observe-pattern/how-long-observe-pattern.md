There are many interesting while at the same time very tricky problems in
statistics. One famous question is that how many steps (expected) does
it take to observe a given sequence (e.g. THTH, TTHH), if we flip a
balanced coin?

This problem can be solved using (delay) renewal theory or martingales.
These two methods are well explained in stochastic processes text books
(e.g. Stochastic Processes, S. M. Ross), so I will not explain them here. 
I implemented an algorithm base on martingales in Mathematica. 
It can deal with all this kind of problems, no matter how
long the pattern to be observed is and no matter which discrete distribution
is specified for the sample space. The following are some running results in
Mathematica.

    sp = {"H", "T"};
    pat1 = {"H","H", "T", "T"};
    pat2 = {"H", "T", "H","T"};
    PatternExpectedTime[pat1, sp]
    16
    PatternExpectedTime[pat2, sp]
    20

Some people might be shock by the above results, because they either think
that the result should be the same, or they think that the expected time for
patter "HTHT" to occur should be smaller. Notice that pattern "HTHT" has a
duplicated structure which is the reason make it harder to occur. To be clearer,
we know that a random sequence generated by flipping a coin n times won't have
a big chance to have either too many or too few runs. Duplicated structures
usually result in too many runs in sequence, e.g. "HTHT" has four runs which
is the biggest run we can have in a sequence of length 4, so it would take more
time on average for "HTHT" to come out.

Here are [more examples and results][] of the [code][].
You need either Mathematica or CDF player to open the code.
For you convenience, the code is also presented below. 
Notice that the code also contains a function for calculating the probability for a 
pattern to come out before other patterns. 
For a more detail description about this interesting problem see my post
