## About String Functions

0. The uniform random variables generated by VB is pretty good.
At least it's acceptable according to the test in R.

1. String functions that return a string can be used with a dollar sign at the end, 
which is a faster version of the corresponding function.

2. The function `trim` gets rid of leading and trailing spaces.

3. The function `instr` supports both case sensitive and case insensitive comparisons.

4. The function `split` can split a string into a string array.
