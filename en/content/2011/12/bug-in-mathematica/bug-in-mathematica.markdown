Mathematica is a very intelligent and powerful math software. 
I use it in my study and research a lot. 
Mathematica's ability to take derivative and to calculate 
limit is obvious powerfulâ€“way much beyond many mathematician's ability. 
Mathematica's ability to calculate integral is also powerful. 
There are many integrals than I'm not able to solve while Mathmatica can. 
For a long time I totally trusted Mathematica. 
I thought that it is so intelligent an software that whenever 
it's able to give me a result it must right, 
until one day I asked Mathematica to do some integrals.  
See whether you can find what's wrong with Mathematica.

What I learn is not just this bug in Mathmatica. 
What I learned is that software has bugs, no matter how intelligent it is. 
Bugs happens when a software grow large. 
Never fully trust a software. You should always judge the result based on your own knowledge.
