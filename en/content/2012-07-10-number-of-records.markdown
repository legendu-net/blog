Suppose there are $n$ distinct numbers $x_1,\ldots, x_n$,
 and $y_1, \ldots, y_n$ is a random permutations of them.
 If $\exists k$ such that $y_k<y_i, \forall 1\le i<k$,
 then we say that $y_k$ is a record 
 (we always count $y_1$ as a record).
 What is the expected number of records in $y_1, \ldots, y_n$?

See my neat solution [here](http://dclong.github.io/media/records/records.pdf).
