## Array

1. The method `push` inserts an element to the back of the arry; 
the method `insert` inserts an element to any place of the array.

2. The method `pop` removes the last element of the array;
the method `delete` removes any specified element from the array.

3. The method `concat` combines the array with another one;
the method `join` concatenates all elements in the array separated 
by the specified delimiter. 

## String

3. Use the method `to_i` to convert a string to integer.

2. You use both single and double quotes to denote string. 
The difference is that single quotes preserves 
escape characters while double quotes interprete escape characters.

3. The method `end_with?` check whether a string ends with the specified string.

4. The method `upcase` returns a copy of the string with lower case letters
replaced with their upper case letters; 
the method `downcase` returns a copy of the string with upper case letters 
replaced with their lower case letters;
the method `swapcase` return a copy of the string with lower case letters 
replaced with their upper case letters and upper case character replaced with 
their lower case letters. 

5. Use the method `strip` to remove leading and trailing white spaces.


## Input and Output

1. Both the function `puts` and `print` display the content of objects 
on the console. The difference is that the function `puts` add a new line
to the end if their is no one while `print` not.

2. The function `gets` read in input from the console. 
You can use the `chomp` method to ignore new lines,
i.e., you can use `gets.chomp` to read a single line from the console.

## File and Directory

1. You can use the method `Dir.entries` to query files and subdirectories
in a directory.

2. The method `File.delete` removes files specified files. 
The number of files passed as arguments is returned. 

## Flow Control

1. You cannot use `else if` in Ruby, instead you can use `elsif`.



## Object and Class
4. Use `methods` to query all methods of an object.

1. You'd not define a function with the same as some directly usable function/method in Ruby.
