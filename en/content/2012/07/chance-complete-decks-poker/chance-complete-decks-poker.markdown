Suppose a poker games requires 4 decks of poker.
After the game, the cards are put back into the 4 decks randomly.
Now there is another game which requires only 1 deck of poker,
so we want to open some decks of the poker and find a complete set of cards.
Since people are lazy, 
we do not want to open all the 4 decks of poker.
If we open 2 decks of cards, 
what is the probability that we can get a complete set of cards?

It is hard to solve this specific problem directly.
The viewpoint of treating a deck of cards as a whole is especially a barrier for solving this problem.
Here is the fancy idea.
We can generalize this problem as follows.
Suppose there are $N$ distinct cards in a deck of poker.
Now $M$ decks of pokers are mixed together and then put back.
If we draw $n$ cards randomly,
what is the probability that we get $m$ types (cards of the same color and suit are consider to be the same type) of cards?
Now to answer the question that how much chance we can get a complete set of cards if we open $k$ decks of poker,
we just need to calculate the probability of getting $N$ types of cards,
if we draw $kN$ cards randomly from these mixed cards.


Let's use $A_{n,m}$ to stand for the event of getting $m$ types of cards when $n$ cards are randomly drawn,
and $P_{n,m}\equiv P(A_{n,m})$.
Then conditioning on the number of types of cards we get in the first $n-1$ draws,
we have the following recursion formula
    $$
    P_{n,m}=P_{n-1,m}\frac{mM-n+1}{NM-n+1}+P_{n-1,m-1}\frac{(N-m+1)M}{NM-n+1}.
    $$
We can find a formula for general terms using method of generating functions.
Since there are two subscript changing at the same time,
it is much harder to solve this recursion formula.
However, 
as I mentioned before, 
we have actually solved the problem from
practical view because we have recursion formula and we know the initial values.
We can write a program to help us solve this problem.
The following is an implementation of the recursion formula in Mathematica.

    GeneralizedHyperGeometryProbability::illegal = "The number of selected exeeds the total number.";
    (*
    @param nselected: the number of card selected;
    @param ndistinct: the number of distinct card in the selected card;
    @param Ndistinct: the total number of distinct card;
    @param Ncopies: the copies of poker.
    *)
    GeneralizedHyperGeometryProbability[nselected_, ndistinct_, Ndistinct_, Ncopies_] := Module[
        {TotalCardsNumber, TotalChoices, i, j, result = {}, n, nleft},
        TotalCardsNumber = Ndistinct*Ncopies;
        If[TotalCardsNumber < nselected, 
            Message[GeneralizedHyperGeometryProbability::illegal]; 
            Return[False]
        ];
        If[Ndistinct < ndistinct, Return[0]];
        If[nselected < ndistinct, Return[0]];
        If[ndistinct * Ncopies < nselected, Return[0]];
        If[ndistinct == 1,
            Return[Ndistinct * Binomial[Ncopies, nselected] / Binomial[TotalCardsNumber, nselected]]
        ];
        TotalChoices = Binomial[TotalCardsNumber, nselected];
        If[nselected == ndistinct,
            Return[Binomial[Ndistinct, ndistinct]*Ncopies^ndistinct/TotalChoices]
        ];
        For[i = 1, i <= ndistinct, i++,
            AppendTo[result, 
            GeneralizedHyperGeometryProbability[i, i, Ndistinct, Ncopies]]
        ];
        For[i = 2, i <= nselected - ndistinct + 1, i++,
            result[[1]] = GeneralizedHyperGeometryProbability[i, 1, Ndistinct, Ncopies];
            For[j = 2, j <= ndistinct, j++,
                n = j - 1 + i;
                nleft = TotalCardsNumber - n + 1;
                result[[j]] = result[[j]]*(j*Ncopies - n + 1)/nleft + result[[j - 1]]*(Ndistinct - j + 1)*Ncopies/nleft
            ]
        ];
        Return[result[[ndistinct]]]
    ]

    In[5]:= N[GeneralizedHyperGeometryProbability[54*1, 54, 54, 4]]
    Out[5]= 9.19323*10^-20
    In[6]:= N[GeneralizedHyperGeometryProbability[54*2, 54, 54, 4]]
    Out[6]= 0.0190881
    In[7]:= N[GeneralizedHyperGeometryProbability[54*3, 54, 54, 4]]
    Out[7]= 0.820296

And the following is another implementation of the recursion formula in R.

    #'
    #' @param nselected the number of card selected;
    #' @param ndistinct the number of distinct card in the selected card;
    #' @param Ndistinct the total number of distinct card;
    #' @param Ncopies the copies of poker.
    #'
    pghyper = function(nselected, ndistinct, Ndistinct, Ncopies){
        TotalCardsNumber = Ndistinct*Ncopies
        if(TotalCardsNumber < nselected)
            stop("the number of selected exceeds the total number.")
        if(Ndistinct < ndistinct)
            return(0)
        if(nselected < ndistinct)
            return(0)
        if(ndistinct * Ncopies < nselected)
            return(0)
        TotalChoices = choose(TotalCardsNumber, nselected)
        if(ndistinct == 1)
            return(Ndistinct * choose(Ncopies, nselected) / TotalChoices)
        if(nselected == ndistinct){
            dchoices = choose(Ndistinct, ndistinct)
            multiple = Ncopies ^ ndistinct
            if(dchoices < multiple)
                return(multiple / (TotalChoices / dchoices))
            else
                return(dchoices / (TotalChoices / multiple))
        }
        result = NULL
        for(i in 1:ndistinct)
            result = c(result, pghyper(i, i, Ndistinct, Ncopies))
        for(i in 2:(nselected-ndistinct+1)){
            result[1]=pghyper(i,1,Ndistinct,Ncopies)
            for(j in 2:ndistinct){
                n=j-1+i
                nleft=TotalCardsNumber-n+1
                result[j]=result[j]*(j*Ncopies-n+1)/nleft
                +result[j-1]*(Ndistinct-j+1)*Ncopies/nleft
            }
        }
        result[ndistinct]
    }

    > pghyper(54*1,54,54,4)
    [1] 9.19323e-20
    > pghyper(54*2,54,54,4)
    [1] 0.01908814
    > pghyper(54*3,54,54,4)
    [1] 0.8202961

From the above result,
we can see that in the original problem the probability 
is only about $2\%$ for us to get a complete set of cards
if we only open 2 decks of pokers 
while the probability is about $82\%$ if we open one more deck of poker (i.e. open 3 decks of pokers).
So for a really lazy person, it seems that to open 3 decks of poker is a good choice.
Let $f(k)=P_{54k,54}, k=1,\ldots, 4$.
The above result also suggests us that function $f(k)$ is a very odd function.
It is small when $k$ is smaller and then suddenly increases to a (relative) very big value,
and then it increases mildly to 1.
Now suppose there are 20 decks of poker (each has 54 cards) involved,
let's see how function $f(k)=P_{54k,54}$, $k=1,\ldots, 20$, behaves.
The plot of the function $f(k)=P_{54k,54}$, $k=1,\ldots, 20$, 
is shown is in the following figure. 
We can see that for very small $k$, $f(k)$ is very small;
then $f(k)$ increase dramatically to a (relative) very big value and then it increase mildly to 1.
For other number of decks of poker, $f(k)$ has similar properties.
So in this kind of problems, definitely we will not have a big probability to success if open 1 or 2
decks of poker. However, we do not have to open too many decks of poker, e.g., 4 or 5 decks would
yield a remarkable success probability even if many (e.g., 100) decks of pokers are involved.
