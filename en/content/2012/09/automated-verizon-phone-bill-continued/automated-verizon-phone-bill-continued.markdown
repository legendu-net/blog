I have switched to the "Share Everything" plan of Verizon two weeks ago,
and I got a little complex bill this month due to people leaving and joining my family plan. 
My ruby program for parsing phone bill still works well. 
It is actually surprising smarter than I thought on this complicated bill. 
Big congratulations to myself!
