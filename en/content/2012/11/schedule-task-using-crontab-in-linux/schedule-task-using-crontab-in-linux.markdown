Note: Crontab is great for simple scheduling requests. 
For complicated scheduling with many dependencies 
you probably want to go with 
[AirFlow](http://www.legendu.net/misc/blog/apache-airflow-tips)
.

1. There are 6 fields that you need to fill for a task to be schedule: 
    `m`, `h`, `dom`, `mon`, `dow` and `command`,
    which stand for the minute, the hour, the day of month, the month, the day of week 
    (of the scheduled time), 
    and the command to run, respectively.
    The graph below shows possible values for each field.

        ┌────────── minute (0 - 59)
        │ ┌──────── hour (0 - 23)
        │ │ ┌────── day of month (1 - 31)
        │ │ │ ┌──── month (1 - 12)
        │ │ │ │ ┌── day of week (0 - 6 => Sunday - Saturday, or
        │ │ │ │ │                1 - 7 => Monday - Sunday)
        ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓
        * * * * * command to be executed

    Notice that abbreviations of days (MON, TUE, etc.) can be used for the field `dow`.
    For example `SUN,MON,THU` for (day of week) 
    will exectute the command on Sundays, Mondays on Thursdays.
    [Crontab Guru](https://crontab.guru/)
    is a quick and simple editor for cron schedule expressions.

2. The information of scheuled tasks are saved in the file `/etc/crontab`. 
    It contains scheduled tasks of all users.
    Though you can schedule tasks by editing the file directly,
    you'd better not.
    It is suggested that you use the command `crontab -e` to schedule tasks.
    If you just want to add crontab tasks,
    an alternative way is to save the information of tasks in a file (e.g. `task.txt`),
    and then run the command `crontab task.txt` to import it.
    To list all scheduled tasks, 
    run the command `crontab -l`.
    To remove a sheduled task,
    use the command `crontab -r`.

3. As long as you use the `crontab` commands to edit the file `/etc/crontab`,
    you do NOT have to restart `cron`.
    `cron` will automatically reload tasks that were changed.
    The log of cron jobs can be found at 
    `/var/log/syslog` (Ubuntu) or `/var/log/cron` (CentOS).
    If you do not have read permission to the log files, 
    you can redict the standard output and error messages of a cron job when you schedule it. 
    Please find an example below.

4. You can schedule a frequently run task using crontab 
    and then reduce the running frequency of the application in your scripts.
    Below is such an example in Bash shell.

        if [[ $(date +%H) =~ ^(10|12|14|16|18)$ ]]; then
            ...
        fi

    This trick is useful to avoid editing crontab tasks frequently
    as you can control (or more precisely, reduce) the frequency of the task 
    in your script directly.

## Cron Job Examples 

1. Run the command `duplicity.lbp` at 03:00 every Thursday. 

        0   3   *     *     5     duplicity.lbp 

2. Run the command `rsnapshot daily` daily at 22:00. 

        0   22  *     *     *     rsnapshot daily

3. Run the command `rsnapshot daily` hourly at the 5th minutes,
    and redict standard output and error messages to `/home/dclong/cron.log`.

        5   *   *     *     *     /home/dclong/schedule.sh >> /home/dclong/cron.log 2> &1

## Start a Crontab Service on Ubuntu

```
# start cron service
sudo service cron start
# check status of the cron service 
service cron status
# stop the cron service
service cron stop
```

## Check Crontab Logs

You can use the following command to check crontab logs on Ubuntu.
```
sudo cat /var/log/syslog | grep cron
```
