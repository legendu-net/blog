0. `JabRef` is an open-source cross-plotform software for managing scientific references.
`Mendeley` is a good cost-free cross-platform software for managing scientific references.
It introduces the concept of social research.

1. If you use bibtex in your LaTeX code, 
you have to compile your code using `pdflatex/latex`, `bibtex`, `pdflatex/latex` and `pdflatex/latex` in sequence.

2. `natbib` is a LaTeX package for citing references, and it is compatible with bibtex.

3. If you use author and date style references and there are duplicate
authors and years, `natbib` print out the whole list of names and years
by default instead of using abbreviation for names. To avoid this
problem, you can add letters to the end of years. (not sure about this ...)

4. The `\eqref` command is convenient way to reference equations in LaTeX.
