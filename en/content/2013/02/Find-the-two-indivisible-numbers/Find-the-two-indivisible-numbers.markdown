I met a friend majored in math on a bus home today. 
He held a piece of paper with a question 
(probably an interview question since he is trying to find a job recently).
He asked the question to me and I found it to be an interesting one. 

A very large positive integer is divisible by all 
but two of the integers 

$$1, 2, 3, \dots, 10000,$$

and the two excepted numbers are consecutive integers.
What are the two integers?


I did not get the answer before my friend get off the bus. 
However, as soon as arriving home I get the key to the questions. 
The outline of my thoughts leading to the answer is as follows.

1. Assume the question is valid, 
i.e., there is a unique answer to this problem.

2. Both of the two numbers (indivisible to the large integer) 
have prime factorization of the form: $a^b$,
where $b$ is the largest possible value. 

3. Since one of two consecutive integers is even, 
one of the two numbers (indivisible to the large integer) has
the form $2^b$ and thus is $2^{13}=8192$. 

4. The other number must be either `8193` or `8191`. 
Since `8193` is divisible to `3` but not `9` 
(`8 + 1 + 9 + 3 = 21` is a multiple of `3` but not `9`), 
it does not have the form mentioned in step 2.
So the other number is `8191`.
