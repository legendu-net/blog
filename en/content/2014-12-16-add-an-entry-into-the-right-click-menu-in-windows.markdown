edit the registry following the steps below.

0. Open the registry.
You can search for `regedit` in Windows Start menu and run it.

1. Navigate to the key
`HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\Background\shell`
in the registry.

2. Create another key with any name (e.g., rstudio) under 
`HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\Background\shell`.

in the right-side pane of the registry.
This value (Rstudio) shows up in the right-click menu whenever you right click.

4. Create another key named `command` under the newly created key (rstudio).
