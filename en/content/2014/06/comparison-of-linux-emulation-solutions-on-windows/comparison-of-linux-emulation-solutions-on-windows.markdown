1. Virtual machine based on Virtualbox, etc. is an overkill, 
    generally speaking.
    It provides complete functionalities 
    but is more CPU and memory hangry.

2. WSL 2 is the currently the best solution comes with Windows 10+.
    It is essentially a virtual machine but based on Hyper-V.

3. Cygwin, MobaXterm, etc. are outdated 
    as WSL 2 is an integrated solution in Windows 10+.
