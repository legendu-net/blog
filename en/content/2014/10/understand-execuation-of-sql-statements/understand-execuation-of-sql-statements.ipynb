    "the (INNER|LEFT|RIGHT|FULL) `JOIN (ON)` is executed if any (see more explanation later).\n",
    "Second, \n",

    "1. It is suggested that you avoid or minize the use of outer joins.\n",

    "### Filter Conditions in `JOIN ON` vs in `WHERE`\n",
    "\n",
    "An `INNER JOIN` first creates a cross join of tables in the `JOIN` clause \n",
    "(i.e., a Cartesian product of rows from tables in the `JOIN` clause), \n",
    "then it selects rows satisfying the `ON` condition from the cross join result. \n",
    "A `LEFT/RIGHT/FULL JOIN` consists of 2 sub steps. \n",
    "First, an `INNER JOIN (ON)` is performed. \n",
    "Second, unmatched rows in the left/right/both table(s) are appended into the resulting table of `INNER JOIN (ON)`. \n",
    "This means that all rows in the left/right/both table(s) will be in the resulting table\n",
    "if there is no `WHERE` or `HAVING` condition in the query.\n",
    "Notice that unmatched rows in the left/right/both table(s) uses `NULL` values for columns in the other table,\n",
    "which is different from the Cartesian product (which uses values of the matched row). \n",
    "After joining, \n",
    "the `WHERE` clause is executed. \n",
    "This means that the `WHERE` condition is executed after the `ON` condition in `JOIN`. \n",
    "For an `INNER JOIN`, \n",
    "the `WHERE` condition can be put in the `ON` condition \n",
    "using `AND` because no extras (unmatched rows) are appended after the `ON` condition is executed. \n",
    "However, for a `LEFT/RIGHT/FULL JOIN` (extra unmatched rows are appended after `ON` condition is executed) \n",
    "the `WHERE` condition cannot be combined with the `ON` condition (using `AND`), generally speaking. \n",
