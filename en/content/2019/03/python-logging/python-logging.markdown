## General Tips

1. [logging](http://www.legendu.net/misc/blog/python-logging-module/)
    is a Python module for logging coming with the standard library
    while
    [loguru](http://www.legendu.net/misc/blog/python-logging-made-stupidly-simple-with-loguru/)
    is a popular 3rd-party logging library.
    Unless you do not want your Python package/script to depend on 3rd-party libraries,
    `loguru` is preferred to `logging` for multiple reasons.

    - loguru is easy and fun to use 
    - Good out-of-box experience. They default settings work well for most situations. 
        For example,
        loguru works with Spark by default while logging needs additional configurations.

2. [rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich)
    is a Python library for rich text and beautiful formatting in the terminal.
