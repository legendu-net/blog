My Windows PC in my office slows down signficantly after running for several days.
I have cleaned up the startup applications to the most I can. 
The only way I can think of is to automatically restart the computer early morning every few days. 
The article 
[[Windows10] How to set to automatically restart or shut down the PC at the specified time using Task Scheduler](https://www.sysmiks.com/automatic-restart-shut-down-pc/)
is a great one on how to make Windows restart/shutdown at scheduled time.
