By default, 
IPython (kernel of Jupyter/Lab notebook) disables executation of untrusted code without explicit user input.
If you have notebook whose output containings JavaScript (e.g., JS-based visualiation)
and code wasn't run by you (e.g., the notebook is shared by someone else),
the JS-based output won't be shown by default.
For more explanation,
please refer to 
[Notebook Security](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/security.html#notebook-security).


There are currently 2 ways to trust a notebook.
First, you can trust (multiple) notebooks via command-line.

    :::bash
    jupyter trust path_to_notebook.ipynb
    jupyter trust notebook1.ipynb notebook2.ipynb
    jupyter trust *.ipynb

Second, 
you can trust a notebook using the `Trust Notebook` comamnd from the command tab in the left panel.

1. Click the on the `Commands` tab in the left panel.

2. Search for `Trust Notebook`.

3. Click the `Trust Notebook` button to trust a notebook.
    You will get a prompt to confirm your action.
