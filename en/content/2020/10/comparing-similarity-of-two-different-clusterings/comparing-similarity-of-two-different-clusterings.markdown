The paper
[Comparing Clusterings - An Overview](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~zwp/teach/MVA/cluster_validation.pdf)
has a good view of different metrics for comparing the similarity of 2 clusterings.
Overall, Normalized Mutual Information sounds like a good one.
It is implemented in sklearn as 
[sklearn.metrics.normalized_mutual_info_score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.normalized_mutual_info_score.html#sklearn.metrics.normalized_mutual_info_score)
.
Of course, 
there are many more metrics for measuring similarity of 2 clusters 
(e.g., [Adjusted Rand Index](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.adjusted_rand_score.html))
implemented in sklearn. 
For more details,
please refer to 
[Clustering Metrics](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#clustering-metrics).
