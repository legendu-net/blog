    "[Spark Internals - 6-CacheAndCheckpoint.md](https://github.com/JerryLead/SparkInternals/blob/master/markdown/english/6-CacheAndCheckpoint.md)\n",
    "has a good explanation of persist vs checkpoint. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Persist/Cache in Spark is lazy and doesn't truncate the lineage\n",
    "    while checkpoint is eager (by default) and truncates the lineage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Generally speaking,\n",
    "    `DataFrame.persist` has a better performance than `DataFrame.checkpoint`. \n",
    "    However,\n",
    "    `DataFrame.checkpoint` is more robust and is preferred in any of the following situations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - When running Spark applications on a noisry cluster\n",
    "    - When a DataFrame is computed using lots of partitions (which increases the chance of node failures)\n",
    "    - When you want to be able to recover from a failed Spark application using checkpoints\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Due to issues/bugs in persist/cache and checkpoint,\n",
    "    (see the next 2 sections for details),\n",
    "    manually writing a DataFrame into disk and then read it back\n",

    "## Tips & Traps for Persist/Cache\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The method `DataFrame.cache` is a special case of `DataFrame.persist`.\n",
    "    `DataFrame.cache` caches a DataFrame to the default storage level (`MEMORY_AND_DISK`)\n",
    "    which is equivalent to `DataFrame.persist()` (with the default behavior).\n",
    "    However,\n",
    "    `DataFrame.persist` is more flexible on the storage leve\n",
    "    and is preferred over `DataFrame.cache`. \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. The definition of the class `pyspark.StorageLevel` is as below.\n",
    "\n",
    "        :::python\n",
    "        class pyspark.StorageLevel(useDisk, useMemory, useOffHeap, deserialized, replication = 1)\n",
    "            ...\n",
    "\n",
    "    And it has the following pre-defined instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - DISK_ONLY = StorageLevel(True, False, False, False, 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - DISK_ONLY_2 = StorageLevel(True, False, False, False, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - MEMORY_AND_DISK = StorageLevel(True, True, False, False, 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - MEMORY_AND_DISK_2 = StorageLevel(True, True, False, False, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER = StorageLevel(True, True, False, False, 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER_2 = StorageLevel(True, True, False, False, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - MEMORY_ONLY = StorageLevel(False, True, False, False, 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - MEMORY_ONLY_2 = StorageLevel(False, True, False, False, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - MEMORY_ONLY_SER = StorageLevel(False, True, False, False, 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - MEMORY_ONLY_SER_2 = StorageLevel(False, True, False, False, 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - OFF_HEAP = StorageLevel(True, True, True, False, 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The method `DataFrame.persist` returns itself,\n",
    "    which means that you can chain methods after it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Persist a DataFrame which is used multiple times and expensive to recompute.\n",
    "    Remembe to unpersist it too when the DataFrame is no longer needed. \n",
    "    Even Spark evict data from memory using the LRU (least recently used) strategy\n",
    "    when the caching layer becomes full,\n",
    "    it is still beneficial to unpersist data as soon as it is no used any more to reduce memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Persisting too many DataFrames into memory can cause memory issues.\n",
    "    There are a few ways to address memory issues caused by this.\n",
    "    - Increase memory.\n",
    "    - Persist only the most reused DataFrames into memory.\n",
    "    - Persist other DataFrame into disk. \n",
    "    Generally speaking,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The option `spark.history.store.maxDiskUsage`\n",
    "    controls the maximum disk usage for the local directory \n",
    "    where the cache application history information are stored.\n",
    "    The default is 10G.\n",
    "    You can set it to a larger value if you need to persist large DataFrames to disk. \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. `DataFrame.persist` is lazy\n",
    "    which means that Spark does not compute and persist a DataFrame immediately\n",
    "    but waits until an RDD action on the DataFrame. \n",
    "    This might have 2 undesired side effects.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Other operations/transformation might get optimized together into the execution plan of the DataFrame \n",
    "        which significantly hurts the performance of Spark. \n",
    "        Please refer to the \n",

    "        (and ways to address the problem).\n",
    "    - Too large execution plan without eager caching/persist\n",
    "        might make a Spark application fail.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    If you'd like persist/cache a Spark DataFrame eagerly,\n",
    "    you can manually call the method `DataFrame.count`\n",
    "    (which is a RDD action)\n",
    "    after `DataFrame.persist` to trigger it.\n",
    "    Do NOT use the method `DataFrame.first` instead of `DataFrame.count` in this case,\n",
    "    as even though `DataFrame.first` is also a RDD action,\n",
    "    it will not trigger a full DataFrame persist/caching \n",
    "    but instead only the partition from which a row was retrieved. \n",
    "\n",
    "        :::python\n",
    "        df.cache().count()\n",
    "        \n",
    "3. I encountered a tricky issue with persist/cache\n",
    "    that it computes the DataFrame to be cached twice\n",
    "    (no matter which persist option is specified)\n",
    "    ,\n",
    "    sort of like the \n",
    "    [bug on checkpoint](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-8582)\n",
    "    .\n",

    "    as I don't see any issue on this raised against the community version of Spark.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Another tricky issue that I countered with persist/cache\n",
    "    is that for a Spark DataFrame with a large execution plan,\n",
    "    persist/cache fails to work \n",
