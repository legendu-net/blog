    "## Tips and Traps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The command-line tool of some (e.g., network) applications might be slow to authenticate. \n",
    "    If you use pexect to automate such a command-line tool, \n",
    "    it is best to wait for sometime after sending password using `child.sendline(passwd)`.\n",
    "    If the authentication has ouput on both success and failure,\n",
    "    a smart way is to wait for the success or failure message to come out. \n",
    "\n",
    "        child.expect(\".*success_pattern.*|.*failure_pattern.*\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    If the the output of authentication contains the same keyword (e.g., dclong) on both success and failure,\n",
    "    the pattern can be further simplified.\n",
    "\n",
    "        child.expect(\".*dclong.*\")\n",
    "        \n",
    "2. The method `spawn.interact` gives control of the child process back to the interactive user \n",
    "    (the human at the keyboard). \n",
    "    Keystrokes are sent to the child process, and the stdout and stderr output of the child process is printed.\n",
    "    This is extremely useful \n",
    "    if you only want `pexpect` to hijack the child process for certain interactions.\n",
    "    For example,\n",
    "    if a command-line tool requires both a password and a hardware token for authentication,\n",
    "    you can use `pexpect` to hijack the child process to enter password automatically \n",
    "    and then give control of the child process back to the user to authenticate using hard token."
