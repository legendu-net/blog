1. You can suppress warnings of unchecked exceptions by using 

        :::java
        SuppressWarnings("unchecked") 

    but generally speaking, 
    you cannot suppress warnings of checked exceptions.

2. You can use more than one `catch` blocks if necessary
    but you can only catch one exception in a catch block before Java 7.
    Starting from Java 7, 
    you can catch multiple exceptions in a catch block.
    For example,
    The old style Java code

        :::java
        } catch (FirstException ex) {
             logger.error(ex);
             throw ex;
        } catch (SecondException ex) {
             logger.error(ex);
             throw ex;
        }

    becomes

        :::java
        } catch (FirstException | SecondException ex) {
             logger.error(ex);
            throw ex;
        }

    in Java 7+.

3. To guarantee that some code will be run eventually,
    you have to put it into a `finally` block before Java 7.
    Starting from Java 7, 
    filesystem resources are managed automatically 
    so that you do not have to release them manually in a `finally` block.
    For example,
    old style Java code

        :::java
        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path));
        try {
           return br.readLine();
        } finally {
           br.close();
        }

    becomes

        :::java
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path)) {
           return br.readLine();
        }

    in Java 7.
