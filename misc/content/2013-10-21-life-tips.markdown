## Insurance

1. Geigo is good choice for people who do not have good driving history
but a bad choice for people with good driving history.

Geigo charges about 18% for cancelling policy,
which is terrible!!!

The speed is slow.
Service people are irresponsible.
I have problem to use SSH and NX services.
