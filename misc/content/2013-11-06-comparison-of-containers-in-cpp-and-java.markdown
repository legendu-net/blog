## Plain Old Array
1. The length/size of array is as in the declaration.
Each element of the array is initialized to the default value (null for object).

2. Array in Java does not have a size method, 
but it has a length member. 
This is because the length of an array won't change.
Since String in Java is immutable, 
a string also has a length method instead of size method.
But I think there inconsistent here, they should make String has a length member.

3. int[] a = new int[5];
int a[5];

4. Array in Java is both static and dynatic while array is C/C++ is static. 
Because array is Java is actually object, so the memory is managed automatically.
In C++, array is not object, if you want to make it dynamic, you must manage memory automatically.

5. You almost never need to use array is C++. 
You can use vector instead of array. 
## Class Containers

1. If you create a vector/list in C++ using the constructor taking a capacity parameter,
the vector/list is fully initialized, 
i.e., every element of the vector/list is initialized.
This is different from Java.
If you create an ArrayList in Java using the constructor taking a capacity parameter,
there's no element in the ArrayList, i.e., the ArrayList is empty,
not to mention initialization of elements.

The difference is because, an element of a vector/list in C++ is an object 
and it must have a valid value while an element of an ArrayList in in Java is a reference.
A reference not necessarily has a valid value. 
Rather than initialize every element to be null,
Java is lazy not to do anything.
