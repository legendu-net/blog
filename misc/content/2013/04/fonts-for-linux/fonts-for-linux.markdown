1. `ttf-arphic-uming`, `ttf-wqy-microhei`, `ttf-wqy-zenhei`, `xfonts-wqy` and `ttf-opensymbol` 
are some packages related to Chinese fonts.

2. If you have Adobe Reader installed on your computer, 
you can use Adobe Chinese fonts for free.

2. To check Chinese fonts installed on your computer,
you can use the command `fc-list :lang=zh-cn | sort`.

3. To install extra fonts in linux, 
you can just copy the font files to the directory '$HOME/.fonts'.
To make them in effect, 
you have to run `fc-cache` to update the system fonts cache.

4. If you ever have any fonts problem with Tex Live in Linux, 
install the package `texlive-fonts-extra` (if you haven't done so) and try again.
