1. it seems that even Debian testing is outdated, the package ...

2. use apt-file update/search to find the right file ...

3. use sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata to change time zone

4. do not use the unstable/sid version unless you are a package developer

5. use all package sources instead of just stable, testing or sid
and use pin

6. wajig install pkg/wheezy-backports 
not wajig install pkg/stable-backports
you can use stable-backports in source.list, however

## Installation

2. You'd better not install back ported Linux images, 
because this makes it harder to use Virtualbox.
It's suggested that 
    - you use the Linux image in the testing repository.
    - you always install headers corresponding to images you installed on your machine. 
    - you install virtualbox in the same repository as the Linux image

24. If you install Linux using command line tools 
and then install a desktop environment, you might not boot into DE automatically 
because you also have to install a DE manager, e.g., gdm or lightdm
without the login/DE manager, Linux won't boot into DE.
so removing login/DE manager is a dirty trick to suppress X if you don't know 
how to editing init scripts.
You can always manually start X using `startx`
