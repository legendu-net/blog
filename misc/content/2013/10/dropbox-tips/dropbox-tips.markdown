Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author. 
Please read with your own judgement!

1. Dropbox won't sync files that you don't have the right permissions.

2. You'd better not merge an old Dropbox folder while installing/configuring Dropbox.

3. You'd better not store symbolic links in the Dropbox folder,
    because the symbolic links will be replaced by the real files/folders 
    when synchronized to other computers.
    It might have problem if you push things to a repository 
    and give the symbolic link to public for downloading. 
    Strickly speaking, 
    this is a problem of using symbolic with GIT not with Dropbox.

4. It is not a good idea to put Git repository in Dropbox,
    especially these repositories than generate lots of small files after compiling.
