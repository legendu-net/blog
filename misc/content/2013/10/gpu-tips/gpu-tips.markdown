## List GPU Devices on Linux

You can list GPU devices using the following command on linux.

    :::bash
    lspci -v | grep VGA


## Machine Learning Frameworks Supporting Managing GPU Resources

- [Horovod](https://github.com/horovod/horovod)

- [Apache Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray)

- [ZeRO + DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed)
    is a deep learning optimization library 
    that makes distributed training on GPU clusters easy, efficient, and effective.

## High-level Scientific Libraries with Built-in GPU Support 

- TensorFlow

- PyTorch 

- XGBoost

- LightGBM

- [scikit-cuda](https://github.com/lebedov/scikit-cuda)

- [cudf](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf)

- Numba


## Low-level Libraries for General Purpose GPU Computing

1. CUDA and Vulkan (successor to OpenCL) are the 2 most popular frameworks for GPU computing.
    CUDA is commerical and for Nvidia GPUs only 
    while Vulkan is opensource and support more brand of GPUs.
    Generally speaking, 
    CUDA has slight better performance than Vulkan on Nvidia GPUs.
    It is suggested that you go with CUDA if you want to squeeze the most out of performance.

### Rust

- [ArrayFire-rust](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire-rust)

- [RustaCUDA](https://github.com/bheisler/RustaCUDA)

    Rusty wrapper for the CUDA Driver API.

- [ash](https://github.com/MaikKlein/ash/)
[ash](https://github.com/MaikKlein/ash/)
is a very lightweight wrapper around Vulkan.

- [wgpu-rs](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs)
[wgpu-rs](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs)

- [vulkano](https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano)
[Vulkano](https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano)
is a Rust wrapper around the Vulkan graphics API. 
It follows the Rust philosophy, 
which is that as long as you don't use unsafe code you shouldn't be able to trigger any undefined behavior. 
In the case of Vulkan, this means that non-unsafe code should always conform to valid API usage.
[Vulkano](https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano)
is not as mature as
[ash](https://github.com/MaikKlein/ash/)
.

- [accel](https://github.com/rust-accel/accel)

- [emu](https://github.com/calebwin/emu)

    Emu is a framework for developing safe, robust GPU-accelerated applications in Rust.

https://github.com/zakarumych/gpu-descriptor
Backend agnostic descriptor allocator for Vulkan-like APIs

- [gfx-rs](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx)
[gfx-rs](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx)
is a low-level, cross-platform graphics and compute abstraction library in Rust. 
[gfx-rs](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx)
is hard to use. 
It's recommended for performance-sensitive libraries and engines. 
wgpu-rs is a safe and simple alternative.

## [pathfinder](https://github.com/servo/pathfinder)
[pathfinder](https://github.com/servo/pathfinder)
is a fast, practical, GPU-based rasterizer for fonts and vector graphics 
using OpenGL 3.0+, OpenGL ES 3.0+, WebGL 2, and Metal.

- [wgpu-py](https://github.com/pygfx/wgpu-py)
[wgpu-py](https://github.com/pygfx/wgpu-py)
is a next generation GPU API for Python.
It is a Python lib wrapping wgpu-native and exposing it with a Pythonic API similar to the WebGPU spec.

- [vulkan-kompute](https://github.com/EthicalML/vulkan-kompute)
General purpose GPU compute framework for cross vendor graphics cards 
(AMD, Qualcomm, NVIDIA & friends). 
Blazing fast, mobile-enabled, asynchronous and optimized for advanced GPU data processing usecases.

### C++ 

- [Thrust](https://developer.nvidia.com/thrust)

    Thrust is a parallel algorithms library which resembles the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). 
    Thrust is high-level interface greatly enhances programmer productivity 
    while enabling performance portability between GPUs and multicore CPUs. 
    Interoperability with established technologies (such as CUDA, TBB, and OpenMP) facilitates integration with existing software. 

- [ArrayFire](https://github.com/arrayfire/arrayfire)



### Java

- [aparapi](https://github.com/Syncleus/aparapi)

- [jcuda](https://github.com/jcuda/jcuda)

    Java bindings for CUDA.

## Graphics Rendering

OpenGL
https://github.com/mcfletch/pyopengl

PyOpenGL

GLFW
https://github.com/glfw/glfw
GLFW is an Open Source, multi-platform library for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and Vulkan application development. It provides a simple, platform-independent API for creating windows, contexts and surfaces, reading input, handling events, etc.
