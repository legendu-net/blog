## Health Insurance

1. High Deductible medical insurance + HSA seems to be a good choice.

## Car Insurance

1. partner is a bad insurance choice

2. Progressive is much more expensive than many other insurances, 
such as safeco, partner, etc.

3. safeco is cheap and seems to be better service than partner

3. AMEX is the best credit card for renting cars
becuase it's insurance can be used the as the primary car insurance.

## Coverage

1. Generally speaking, there are 2 choice regarding to coverage: full coverage and half coverage.
The difference is that full coverage often includes collision 
and/or comprehensive which covers damage to your own property. 


If you currently have insurance, are driving less than 40 miles/day on average and live in a qualified zip code you can get some huge discounts. In addition, if you have no DUI’s on your record, you can get even more discounts. Has your car insurance company ever told you that?
