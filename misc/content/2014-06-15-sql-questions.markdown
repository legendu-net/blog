## General SQL Questions

## Teradata Related

1. select, union: strange that sometimes white spaces at the end causes problems ...
not sure this is an issue of Teradata SQL or Teradata Studio

2. is there convenient way to calculate percentiles in Teradata SQL?
Some SQL has `percentile_disc` and `percentile_cont`.

6. sql exist vs in?

14. Is/are the primary key(s) automatically indexed?

1. create PI on multiple columns, what are the advantages and disadvantages?
why not create PI on all columns?

2. Does SQL truncate integer/float computation results?
What is they type of new created columns?

3. how to create a small temp table?

## Questions

1. when join, which talbe to use first? 
Does this affect performance a lot? might be
I heard that you should use the smaller table as the first one.

3. doesn't join create large table sometimes? 
Which is prefered? smaller talbes using multiple queries 
or a really large talbe with just one query?

4. what happens if an left/right join retrieve fields 
from a table with constraint NOT NULL
but match is not found?

5. how to use keywords as column names?

6. how to use space in column names?
In teratadata sql, you can just quote it (double quotes?)

7. prefer to compare numbers or strings?
I think comparing number will be much faster.


8. Is it possible to define variables in teradata sql? 
so that we don't have type the same value again and again?
it seems that there is no simple way to do this

9. what issue does the following style of code have?
recursive? actually will this work? probably not ...
have a try on this ...
```code
create table t as
select * from t;
```
Generally speaking, this does not work. 
You want to avoid it.

1. what is the difference between cast and convert in transaction-SQL (MS SQL)?

sql: some expression is used multiple times, is it better to define it as a column alias and then use it? Better alternative? nad temp volatile volumn?

2. why cannot I create a view in Hopper?

3. which rows are updated in the following code?
```SQL
update #ST_Master
set  #ST_Master.'+ @Var_ST_1st + '= #t1.Var_ST_1st
from  #ST_Master left join #t1
on  #ST_Master.LoanID = #t1.LoanID
```
Must number of rows be the same?

4. is there any way to check functions and function args in SQL?

4. group by and partition over together? partition over runs after group by?

5. is there a better way of formatting besides casting?

6. self join in each group, is there any efficient way to do it? avoid the full n^2 join?
