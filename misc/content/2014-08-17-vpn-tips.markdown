1. You might have difficulties to visit some web pages
when you are using VPN. 
This is probably because the location set by VPN bans 
the web pages you visit.
You can simple choose another location to avoid this issue.

2. The VPN (connections) information are saved in the directory 
`/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/`.
