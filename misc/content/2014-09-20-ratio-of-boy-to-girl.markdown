In a country, all families prefer to have boys. 
They will keep having baby until they have a boy. 
After a long time, what is the ratio of boys to girls in this country?

The popular answer to this questions is 1:1,
however, I think this answer has too strong and simple assumptions. 
Have a think on this problem ...
