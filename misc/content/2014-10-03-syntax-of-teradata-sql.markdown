## Syntax

1. Each Teradata SQL statement must be ended by a semicolon.

5. The keyword `inner` is optional in an `inner join`.

6. To estimate the time and space complexity, 
you can prefix your SQL code by `explain`,
or you can just press the `Explain` button if you use Teradata SQL Assistant.

2. Column names in `select` and `group by`, `order by`, etc. are separated by comma. 
There can be no comma after the last column name.
This is easy to understand. 
If you put comma after the last column in a, e.g., `select` clause,
the `from` keyword will be treated as the last column and results in syntax error.


## Common Syntax Errors

1. Using a comma after the last column or missing a comma 
after a non-last column in the `select` clause.

2. Miss `then` in  a 
```SQL
case 
    when condition_1 then v_1 
    when condition_2 then v_2 
    ...
    else v_k 
end 
```
statement.

3. 
CREATE TABLE Failed. 3706: Syntax error: expected something between ')' and ';'.
forget "with data"

## SQL Style
1. It is suggested that you write SQL code in the following style.
```SQL
create table t0 as
select distinct top 5 *
from
    t1
inner join
    t2
on
    condition
where
    condition
group by
    1
having
    condition
order by
    1
;
```
