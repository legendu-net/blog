## Health Insurance

1. High Deductible medical insurance + HSA seems to be a good choice.

## Home & Car Insurance Companies

- Progressive
- Geico
- StateFrame
- Safeco
- Allstate
- Costco Connect
- American Family

It is best to work with a local agent which servers multiple insurance companies
as the agent is able to pull quote from all companies and tell you cheapest one.
 
## Car Insurance

1. partner is a bad insurance choice

2. Progressive is much more expensive than many other insurances, 
    such as safeco, partner, etc.

3. safeco is cheap and seems to be better service than partner

3. AMEX is the best credit card for renting cars
    becuase it's insurance can be used the as the primary car insurance.

## Coverage

1. Generally speaking, there are 2 choice regarding to coverage: full coverage and half coverage.
    The difference is that full coverage often includes collision 
    and/or comprehensive which covers damage to your own property. 


If you currently have insurance, are driving less than 40 miles/day on average and live in a qualified zip code you can get some huge discounts. In addition, if you have no DUIâ€™s on your record, you can get even more discounts. Has your car insurance company ever told you that?
