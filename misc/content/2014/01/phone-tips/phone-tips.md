**Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author. Please read with your own judgement!**

## Carrier Service in US

1. Ting (based on Sprint network) seems to be a very cheap carrier.

2. T-mobile is also a cheap one.

3. Verizon is way too expensive!

4. Dial `*#06#` to get device info (EID, IMEI, IMEI2 and MEID).

## Wireless Charging

1. **Be careful when using wireless charging**!
    Some phone cases have metal rings which might heat up when placed on a wiress charger.
    You'd better make sure that a phone case is compatible with wireless charging
    or take off the phone cases before charging your phone wirelessly. 

## Android

1. It seems that in order to sync with Google calendar on an Android phone,
    you must have the Google Calendar App installed and setup. 
    You have to go to settings of Google Calendar App, 
    choose an account, and select the calendars that you want to sync.

2. [Termux](https://termux.com/) seems to be a great terminal emulator for Android.


## Carrier Service in China

1. 中国联通用户可以拨打10010转人工服务要求开通账单寄送服务. 
    需要服务密码
    联通设置新服务密码:
    MMCZ#新密码

## 红米

1. 音量减小键 + 菜单: 截屏
