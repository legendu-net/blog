**Things under legendu.net/outdated are outdated technologies that the author does not plan to update any more. Please look for better alternatives.**
 

1. Do not use `email+extra@gmail.com`. 
    This only makes things more complicated.
    Of course, 
    it makes your accounts securer.
    Do not use it to subscribe emails!!!

2. Not a good idea to subscribe to mail list with lots of active discussions.
    Directly read the discussions on website is a better alternative

3. Avoid receiving useless emails. 
    Just unsubscribe emails that you never read.
