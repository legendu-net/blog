**Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author. Please read with your own judgement!**
 

1. CTRL + C as an alternative

2. Map CapsLock to Escape (preferred)

cons: no caps key, 
generally speaking I type lower case and then convert letters to upper case as needed 
u/U ect 

3. Swap CapsLock and Esc 
works very well until you remote to other desktops

4. Map/Swap when needed is also a good idea

Please refer the posts below on how to map keys in Windows, Mac and Linux.
