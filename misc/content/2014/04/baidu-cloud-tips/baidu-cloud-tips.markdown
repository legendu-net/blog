1. Baidu cloud is a good backup solution but not a good synchronization solution.
    Do not try to synchronize your devices via Baidu cloud.

2. `bypy -v upload` 

3. There is a unofficial client for Baidu Cloud 
    at <https://github.com/LiuLang/bcloud>.
    This client support fast upload (comparing hash before uploading).
    However, it is not compatible with Baidu's official client. 
    Suppose a file is uploaded using this unoffical client,
    the offical client won't use fast upload if you upload it again.
    So the suggestion is to stick with one of them.
