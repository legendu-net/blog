Transmission is the best cross-platform BitTorrent Client. 
It is simple, clean 
and support setting the downloading speed to 0 (i.e., disable uploading).

1. segmentation fault, remove configuration files in ~/.config, then restart.

Menu -> Edit -> Preference -> Desktop -> Check "Show Transmission icon in the notification area".
