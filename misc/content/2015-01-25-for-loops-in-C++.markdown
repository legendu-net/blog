There are 3 for loops in C++,
the usual for loop, the range-based for loop (introduced in C++11) and the `std::for_each` for loop.

1. Both the range-based for loop and the `std::for_each` for loop 
applies operations on each eleemnt in a specified container/range.
Both of them are able to mutate elements of a container/range,
but you should never use them to erase elements from a container.
You have to use the usual for loop to erase elements from a container.

2. It is suggested that you use the range-based for loop (introduced in C++11)
in place of `std::for_each` when applicable 
as the range-based for loop is simpler and more readable.
