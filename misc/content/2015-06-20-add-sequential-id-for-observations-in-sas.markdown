data s1;
    set s;
    obs_id = _n_;
run;

proc sql;
    create table s1 as
    select 
        monotonic() as obs_id,
        *
    from
        s
    ;
run;

1. The `monotonic` function runs before `sort` and `group by`.
So even if it gives distinct observation ID,
it guarantees no specific order of observations.
It is suggested that you use the data step approach 
rather than the `nonotonic` way in SQL
if you want the generated observation IDs to preserve some kind of order of observations.
