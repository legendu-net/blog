You can use valgrind with the following options

```bash
valgrind --tool=callgrind ./(Your binary)
```

It will generate a file called callgrind.out.x. 
You can then use kcachegrind tool to read this file. 
It will give you a graphical analysis of things with results like which lines cost how much.
