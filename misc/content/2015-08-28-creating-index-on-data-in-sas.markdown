I am not sure whether creating index will reorder data or not ... 
it seems to me that it does modified the original data, 
but I'm not what are the changes? metadata, or reorder data?

summary on different ways of creating index, proc sql, proc datasets, ..., 
simple vs compound, simple must use the same index name as column name
