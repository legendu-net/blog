In statistics, 
a unit root test tests whether a time series variable is non-stationary using an autoregressive model. 
A well-known test that is valid in large samples is the augmented Dickey–Fuller test. 
The optimal finite sample tests for a unit root in autoregressive models were developed by Denis Sargan and Alok Bhargava. 
Another test is the Phillips–Perron test. 
These tests use the existence of a unit root as the null hypothesis.

In statistics and econometrics, an augmented Dickey–Fuller test (ADF) is a test for a unit root in a time series sample. 
It is an augmented version of the Dickey–Fuller test for a larger and more complicated set of time series models. 
The augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) statistic, used in the test, is a negative number. 
The more negative it is, the stronger the rejection of the hypothesis that there is a unit root at some level of confidence.[1]
