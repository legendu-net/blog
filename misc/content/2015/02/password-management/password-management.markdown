## GUI Password Manager

### [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/)

KeePassXC is a successor of KeePassX.
It is cross-platform.

### LastPass

LassPass saves password online,
which is a security concern.
I suggest you NOT to use LastPass.

### KeePassDroid

teamdrive: slide left a little bit, middle button -> open in minikeepass

### MiniKeePass

it seems that multi-screen makes keepassx auto enter not work well


## Command-line Password Manager

1. kpcli (command line version of KeePassXC)

2. pwman3

3. pass


## Feature Requests

1. keepassX, favorate items, tags, etc
	a. user-defined white spaces is handy

2. keepassx favorate, most frequently used? or others that support this feature?
	you either have to do this by yourself or ask people to add this feature
