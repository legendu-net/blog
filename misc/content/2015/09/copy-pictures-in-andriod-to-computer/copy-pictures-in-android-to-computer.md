You have to have a SSH server installed on the Android phone.
```bash
scp -r -P port user_name@192.168.1.105:/sdcard/DCIM . 
scp -r -P port user_name@192.168.1.105:/sdcard/DCIM/Camera .
scp -r -P port user_name@192.168.1.105:/sdcard/Download .

scp -r -P port user_name@192.168.1.105:/sdcard/Tencent/MicroMsg/WeiXin .
```
