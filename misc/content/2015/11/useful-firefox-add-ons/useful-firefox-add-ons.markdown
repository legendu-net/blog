## Navigation & Shortcut

1. tridactyl

2. vimium-FF

1. Vimperator 

    - Vim-like key bindings, the ultimate plug-in for Firefox

    - outdated in Firefox 57+

2. Pentadactyl

A more powerful but complex alternative to Vimperator.
The main focus of Vimperator is on usability, simplicity, stability and design 
while still preserving a powerful, modal browsing experience influenced by Vim.
The aim of Pentadactyl is to create a complex beast, 
where hackers with too much free time can do any (un-)imaginable thing. 
Also Pentadactyl focuses more on 1:1 Vim compatibility.
