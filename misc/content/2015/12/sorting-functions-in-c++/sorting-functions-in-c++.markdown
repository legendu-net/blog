`std::sort`
`std::stable_sort`
`std::partial_sort`

Notice that only `std::stable_sort` is stable sort (at the cost of additional time/space complexity).
It is easy to achive stable sort using `std::sort` or `std::qsort` by add extra criterias for sorting. 
For example, if you have to sort some nodes by size and want to have stable results, 
you want use the index/name of the nodes as a secondary sorting criteria. 
You can do this by comparing `std::pair` of node size and node index/name.
