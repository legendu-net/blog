1. A volatile table persistents in the duration of the connection that creates it
while a CTE is only accessible by the query following it.
That is the scope of CTE is narrower and is safer.

1. If performance is a concern, use volatile (temp) tables.

2. Always use CTE (with clause) instead of sub queries.
