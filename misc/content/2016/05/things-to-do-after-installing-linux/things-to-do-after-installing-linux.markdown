**
Things on this page are
fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author.
Please read with your own judgement!
**

1. Choose a fast mirror.
If you are using Ubuntu, 
a fast mirror will be automatically decided based on your location. 
However, if you are using other Linux distribution (e.g., Linux Mint),
you might have to choose a fast mirror manually.

2. Install a good alternative package manager.
`apt-get` is a very good package manager for Debian series Linux distributions,
however, `wajig` is much superior choice.
```bash
sudo apt-get install wajig
```

2. Upgrade the system.
```bash
wajig update && wajig upgrade
```

3. Swap the `Caps Lock` key with the `Escape` key.

3. install must have software

    - aria2, uGet
    - install and configure Firefox 
    - skype
    - sogou pinyin
    - transimission
    - teamdrive
