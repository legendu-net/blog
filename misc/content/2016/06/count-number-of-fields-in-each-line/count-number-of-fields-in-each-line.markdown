Do not assume that structured text file are always in correct format.
So often want to count the number of fields in each line in a text file.
```sh
awk '{print NF}' filename
```
Unfortunately, awk does not take escaped characters into consideration.
So this only works for simple formatted (without escaped characters) text files.

There is a function named `count.field` in R.
