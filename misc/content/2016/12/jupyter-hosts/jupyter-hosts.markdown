## [DeepNote](https://deepnote.com/)

Sounds like the best available one now. 
It also supports real-time collaboration among users!

## [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/)

GitPod allows users to use their customized Docker images 
and allow users to expose HTTP services from your workspace.
This means that if you have JupyterLab/Hub installed in your GitPod image,
you can run a JupyterLab/Hub server within your GitPod worksapce and access it from public.
Once you start a new services listing on a port,
a prompt will show up at the right-bottom corner and you can click it to visit the service.
The prompt will disappear after a few seconds or after being clicked. 
You can always use command `gp url port` to find the public URL of an exposed port/service.

Note that GitPod has a timeout of 30 minutes (unless you have the Unlimited Plan) 
if there's no activity on the GitPod IDE page. 
This seriously limit the usability of the JupyterLab server launched from a GitPod workspace.
You will have to go back to the IDE page once for a while 
to make sure that your workspace won't timeout and get killed.
I typically use JupyterLab launched from GitPod for ad hoc short-time tasks,
e.g., writing a notebook-based article for my blog.

## Deploy Your Own Public JupyterHub Server

It is very easy to deploy a Jupyter/Hub/Lab server.
The difficult part is how to make your Jupyter/Hub/Lab secure.
Please refer to
[Running a notebook server](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/public_server.html)
and
[Installing and Running Jupyter Notebooks on a Server](https://janakiev.com/blog/jupyter-notebook-server/)
on how to set up SSL encryption to enable HTTPS for your Jupyter/Hub/Lab server.
