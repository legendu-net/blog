The website [The Python Graph Gallery](https://python-graph-gallery.com/)
displays hundreds of charts, always providing the reproducible python code! 
It aims to showcase the awesome dataviz possibilities of python and to help you benefit it. 

## JS based Modules

### [hvplot](https://github.com/pyviz/hvplot)

A high-level plotting API for pandas, dask, xarray, and networkx built on HoloViews 

### [Cufflink](https://github.com/santosjorge/cufflinks)

Enables plotly plots in pandas DataFrame (via the `iplot` method) directly.

### HoloViews

HoloViews is my favorate JS-based visualization package in Python.
It has the simpliest yet rigorous syntax.

### bokeh

Bokeh is a great JS-based package for visualization in Python and is also available in other programming languages.
It is a free and opensource alternative to plotly (which is not totally free).
Both bokeh and plotly is feature-rich.
They supports all kinds of charts, data table and can easily build a dashboard.

### [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/user-guide/)

Plotly is great (even better than Bokeh) but unfortunately not totally free (very limited API calls per day).

## `matplotlib` based Modules

### matplotlib

The old default visualization package in Python.


has display issues without x server ...

### pandas

`pandas` integrates some visualization features based on matplotlib.
It makes things convenient if you have to work with data frame a lot.
