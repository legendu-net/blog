## Tricks to Write Tail Recursive Calls

1. A useful trick to write tail recursive function is 
to include the result to return as a parameter.
If the result to return is a tuple (or so), 
you just need to include those elements that are not already parameters.

## Tricks that Do Not Need Tail Recursive Calls

Somtimes you don't bother to write a tail recursive function (and don't want use while loop either) 
but still want to have good performance and avoid stack overflow issue. 

1. A good trick is to return Iterator or Stream.

2. If the results to return is numbers or strings, 
you can cache the results using a HashMap to avoid writing tail recursive functions.

3. Say that you want to reduce a seq.
Instead of writing a method to handle the situation of multiple elements,
you can just write a method to handle the situation of 2 elements, 
and then call the `reduce` method.
```scala
seq.reduce(_ youOperator _)
```
