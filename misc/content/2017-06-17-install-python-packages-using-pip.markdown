## PyPi Statistics

You can check download statistics of Python Packages on PYPI at https://pypistats.org/.
This is especially helpful if you want to choose from multiple packages.

## Prefer [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/)

[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/)
is preferred over OS tools
(e.g., `apt-get`, `yum`, `wajig`, `aptitude`, etc.) for managing Python packages.
If you are using Anaconda Python,
use `conda` (instead of `pip`) to manage Python packages
especially when you encounter dependency issues.

## [Install pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

### On Ubuntu

```Bash
apt-get install python3-pip
```

### On Mac

`pip` should have already been installed when you instal Python using Homebrew or Anaconda.

## Bootstrapping the pip Installer

The package [ensurepip](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/ensurepip.html)
provides support for bootstrapping the pip installer into an existing Python installation or virtual environment.

```Bash
sudo python3 -m ensurepip
```

## Proper Way of Using pip

1. pip can be upgrade using the following command. 

        :::bash
        pip3 install --upgrade pip

    However,
    you should avoid doing this (as it might causes issues) 
    unless you have to upgrade and you are an experienced user.
    It is recommended that you upgrade pip via the system package management tools only.

2. Do NOT use `sudo pip install pkg1 pkg2` install packages to system-wide locations. 
    Instead, use `pip install --user pkg1 pkg2` to install packages to your local directory.

## Install Python Packages Locally

You can install Python packages to your local directory 
by specifying the `--user` option to `pip`.
This is extremely useful if you do not have permission 
to install packages to system-wide locations.
```Bash
pip3 install --user mercurial
```
The same option `--user` can be used to install a package to local directory
if you install using the `setup.py` file.
```Bash
python setup.py install --user
```
Notice that if your Python is installed by Homebrew or you are using Anaconda Python,
the whole Python is installed to your local directory,
so that you do not need to use the `--user` option when installing Python packages.

## Install Python Packages from Git Repositories

['pip install' From a Git Repository](https://adamj.eu/tech/2019/03/11/pip-install-from-a-git-repository/)

## Install a Specific Version of a Python Package

1. List all available versions of a Python package. 
    ```
    pip3 install pylibmc==
    ```
2. Install a specific version of a Python package.
    ```
    pip3 install MySQL_python==1.2.2
    ```
3. Install pyarrow with a verison of at least 0.14.0.
    ```
    pip3 install pyarrow>=0.14.0
    ```
4. You can install the pre-release version of a package using the `--pre` option.
    For example, 
    the current version of pybuilder (0.11.7) is not compatible with Python 3.7.
    If you are using Python 3.7 and still want to use the pybuilder package, 
    you can install the pre-release version (0.12) which is compatible with Python 3.7.
    ```
    pip3 install --pre pybuilder
    ```

## Difference between --ignore-installed and --force-reinstall

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51913361/difference-between-pip-install-options-ignore-installed-and-force-reinstall

https://github.com/blockstack/blockstack-core/issues/504

Sometimes a package is installed by distutils
which cannot be reinstalled using `pip`, 
not even with the `--force-reinstall` option.
In that case, 
you have to use the `--ignore-installed` option.

## Install Python Packages Without Installing Dependencies

```
pip3 install --no-deps some_package
```

## Upgrade Python Packages

```sh
pip3 install --upgrade wheel
```

## List All Installed Python Packages

1. List all installed modules.
    ```
    pip3 list --outdated
    ```

2. List outdated modules only.
    ```
    pip3 list --outdated
    ```

3. You can also use `help('modules')` to show all installed modules in Python.

## Use pip with Proxy

You can export environment variables `http_proxy` and `https_proxy`
or you can use `pip` with the `--proxy` option directly.
```Bash
pip3 --proxy http://proxy__server_ip:port install some_pkg
```
When using the `--proxy` with `pip`/`pip3`, 
you can omit `http://` and the port if the port is 80.
```Bash
pip3 --proxy 10.135.227.47 search notifiers
```

Notice that sometimes `pip` does not respect the environment variables.
In that case, 
you have to use the option `--proxy` to pass proxy to `pip`.
And even with the option `--proxy`,
pip might not work well if you install from a version control system. 
Just be ware of that.
[ProxyChains](http://www.legendu.net/misc/blog/proxychains-tips/)
is likely a solution when that issue happens.

## Install from Source

pip 20.0+ supports instaling a peotry managed Python project from GitHub directly.
For example,
the comamnd below installs the Python package dsutil from the GitHub repository dclong/dsutil directly.

    :::bash
    pip3 install git+ssh://git@github.com/dclong/dsutil 
    # or
    pip3 install git+https://github.com/dclong/xinstall


If you are behind a corporate proxy,
you might need 2FA to visit the enterprise GitHub of your company.
However, 
2FA is usually not required for Git comamnd line (since it would too much hassle).
The above way to install Python packages from GitHub repositories directly
can be a good way to avoid 2FA authentication if you are behind a corporate proxy.


Below are some more supported protocols.

    :::bash
    pip3 install git+ssh://
    pip install git+https://...
    pip install git+git://...
    pip install git+ssh://...

## Caching

1. You can disable pip caching using the option `--no-cache-dir`.

## Misc

1. `pip` supports downloading without installation!

2. Install from the current directory

        :::bash
        pip3 install .

4. `export LC_ALL=C` resolved an issues of pip3
