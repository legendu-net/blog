1. Docker can be installed in WSL starting from the Win 10 Creator update,
however, 
there are still all kinds of issues running Docker in WSL.


## Use Docker on Windows in WSL

### Install Docker on Windows

To install the Docker engine on Windows, 
just go to docker.com and download the appropriate distribution. 
Also, 
make sure hardware virtualization is enabled and Hyper-V is installed, 
lest the engine won’t start.

### Run Docker in WSL

With Windows 10 Creators Update*, 
accomplishing all of this has become a lot simpler, 
since it allows you to run Windows executables from Bash. 
Just add these two lines to your .bashrc and you are done!

    PATH="$HOME/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
    PATH="$PATH:/mnt/c/Program\ Files/Docker/Docker/resources/bin"
