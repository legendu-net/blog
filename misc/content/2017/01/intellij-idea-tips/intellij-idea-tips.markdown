## General Tips

1. It is suggested that you develop a Scala project using Gradle.
    Maven is too verbose and sbt is too hard to use.

2. You need good network connection when create a new Scala project 
    since the project manage tool (Gradle, sbt or maven) has to fetch lots of JAR dependencies.

3. It is suggested that you use JupyterLab notebook 
    (instead of using Scala worksheet in IntelliJ IDEA) if you want to run Scala interactively.
    The BeakerX Scala kernel is a good one.

4. Close IntelliJ IDEA if you don't use it.
    First, 
    this save memory and make your machine run faster.
    Second, 
    this helps avoiding some tricky issues that happens when IntelliJ IDEA runs for a long time 
    (especially on Mac where people typically don't quit applications and don't restart for a long time).
    Some of the tricky issues can be resolved simplify by restarting IntelliJ IDEA,
    so closing IntelliJ IDEA if you don't use it helps preventing these tricky issues from happening.

5. If you encounter some tricky issues in IntellIJ IDEA that doesn't seem to be caused by coding errors,
    you can first restart IntelliJ IDEA, 
    and then do a clean build to see whether the issue is resolved.

## Tricks & Traps 

1. Close your project and quit IntelliJ IDEA.

2. Rename the project directory to match the name of your project if they don't match.

3. Restart IntelliJ.

4. Go to the menu `File -> Invalidate Caches/Restart -> Invalidate and Restart`.

## Issues & Solutions


I just had this issue, also. It turned out that IntelliJ hadn't marked my src/main/scala folder as a "source" folder.

To do this: Project Structure -> Modules -> right click folder and Mark as "Source" (blue)

Similarly the src/main/test folder wasn't marked as a test folder. I was able to add scala classes after those folders were appropriately marked.

First of all you should try File | Invalidate Caches and if it doesn't help, delete IDEA system directory. Then re-import the Maven project and see if it helps.

In some weird cases compiled classes may report wrong info and confuse IDEA. Verify that the classes from this jar report correct names using javap.
