1. AnBox CANNOT be run on macOS.
    
2. There was a limited support of ARM-only app on x86-based Linux OS.
    However,
    Android 11+ images are capable of running ARM apps on x86-based machines. 
    This means that AnBox is capable of running ARM apps now
    with Android 11+ images. 
    For more details,
    please refer to
