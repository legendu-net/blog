**Things under legendu.net/outdated are outdated technologies that the author does not plan to update any more. Please look for better alternatives.**

1. KDE supports the Win/Super key to bring up the application launcher now.
    If you are on an older KDE distributions which does not have it by default,
    you can get it enabled by installing the `ksuperkey` package.

2. Win + Arrow to resize windows.
