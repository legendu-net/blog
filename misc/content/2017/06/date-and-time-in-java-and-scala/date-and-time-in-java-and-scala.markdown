Use Joda time if you are using JDK <= 7
and java.time if you are using JDK8 and above.

If you do prefer Scala libraries (when working in Scala),
https://github.com/nscala-time/nscala-time wrapper of Joda time

    libraryDependencies += "com.github.nscala-time" %% "nscala-time" % "2.16.0"


https://github.com/reactivecodes/scala-time
wrapper of java.time

    // Requires JDK 1.8 and above
    "codes.reactive" %% "scala-time" % "0.4.1"
