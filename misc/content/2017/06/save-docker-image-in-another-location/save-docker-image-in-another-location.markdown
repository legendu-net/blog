Docker images are saved in `/var/lib/docker`. 
You can link the directory to another place to save images elsewhere.
Another way is to change the configuration file of Docker.
For example, 
you can add the following into `/etc/default/docker` 
to save docker images into `/mnt` (instead of the default location).
```
DOCKER_OPTS="-dns 8.8.8.8 -dns 8.8.4.4 -g /mnt"
```

1. symbolic link

2. bind mount (check 
    [Specifying a default Docker storage directory by using bind mount](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBS6K_3.1.1/installing/docker_dir.html)
    for more details)

3. Add the options into the file `/etc/docker/daemon.json`.

        :::json
        {
            "data-root": "/new/data/root/path"
        }

Restart Docker after whichever approach you take.

    :::bash
    sudo systemctl restart docker
