**Things under legendu.net/outdated are outdated technologies that the author does not plan to update any more. Please look for better alternatives.**



1. The recommended building tool for Sclas is [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) 
    \> [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 
    \> [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/).
    Maven is too verbosal while sbt is too hard to use.
