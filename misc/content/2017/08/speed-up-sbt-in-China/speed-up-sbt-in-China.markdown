Currently `sbt` uses https by default. 
However, the Great Firewall of China makes https visits to websites out of China slow. 

## Proxy

If you have access to proxy server, 
it is probably the most convenient way. 

1.  HTTP Proxy

        export JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Dhttp.proxyHost=yourserver -Dhttp.proxyPort=8080 -Dhttp.proxyUser=username -Dhttp.proxyPassword=password"
        sbt 

2. Socks Proxy 

        sbt -DsocksProxyHost=proxy_ip -DsocksProxyPort=port 

## Repository Mirror (Proxy Repository)

`sbt` uses Ivy to resolve library dependencies. 
However, 
unlike Gradle `sbt` does NOT inherit Maven configurations. 
You have to configure `sbt` separately. 
It is really easy to set up proxy repositories for `sbt`. 
All you have to do is to add the following section into the file 
`~/.sbt/repositories`.

    [repositories]
        local
        aliyun: http://maven.aliyun.com/nexus/content/groups/public/
        central: http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/

The repositories are used in the order local > aliyun > central. 
You can add other repositories similarly (using the ke: value format). 
[Ali Maven Mirror](http://maven.aliyun.com/nexus/#welcome) 
is great for use in China.
