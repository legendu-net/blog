1. Both ScalaTest and spec2 are good unit testing frameworks. 
    ScalaTest is more flexible is recommended.

## ScalaTest

only `assert` is supported. 

    :::bash
    assert(expr1 === expr2, optional_msg)

The JUnit methods `assertTrue`, `assertEquals` and `assertArrayEquals` 
are not supported by default.
You have to import them from JUnit if you want use them.

    :::bash
    import org.scalatest.junit.AssertionsForJUnit
    import org.junit.Assert.{assertEquals, assertNotNull}

Keep eyes on sbt-idea ..., 
check whether a plugin for IntelliJ is available, ...

It seems that supersafe has issues with scala 2.12.2 ...

https://github.com/scalatest/scalatest/issues/1156




Try the following:

When we add the plug-in in `projects/build.sbt`:

    addSbtPlugin("com.artima.supersafe" % "sbtplugin" % "1.1.2")

We must not add the above plug-in anywhere else

Add to `~/.sbt/0.13/global.sbt`

    resolvers += "Artima Maven Repository" at "http://repo.artima.com/releases"

Do not add this resolver anywhere else

Make sure you have an empty line before and after each of the sbt lines


## Specs2

    "org.specs2" % "specs2-core_2.11" % "3.7.2" % "test",

    "org.specs2" % "specs2-mock_2.11" % "3.7.2" % "test"
