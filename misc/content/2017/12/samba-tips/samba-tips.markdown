SAMBA File System is a great way to share files among computers in local network (e.g., office or home).
You do NOT need a synchronization software.
However,
if you use SAMBA in office,
make sure that the file permissions are as you expected.
Some companies make SAMBA file system accessible to everyone!

## Mount Windows Samba Share on Ubuntu
```
sudo mount //WINSRV/SHARE -t cifs -o uid=1000,gid=1000,username=winuser /mnt/path
```

## Mount Samba in WSL

It is now possible to mount USB media (including formatted as FAT)
and network shares with `drvfs` on Windows 10.

You can use the following command to mount removable media (e.g. D:).
```
sudo mkdir /mnt/d
sudo mount -t drvfs D: /mnt/d
```
And use the following command to safely unmount it.
```
sudo umount /mnt/d
```
You can also mount network shares without `smbfs`.
```
sudo mount -t drvfs '\\server\share' /mnt/share
```
