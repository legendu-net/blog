## GUI Tools

### [transmission](http://www.legendu.net/misc/blog/transmssion-tips)

Transmission is the BEST cross-platform BitTorrent client.
It is simple, clean 
and allows setting the uploading speed to zero (i.e., disable upload),
which almost all other BitTorrent clients do not support. 

### [Motrix](https://github.com/agalwood/Motrix)
Motrix is a good cross-platform general purpose downloading tool.
However,
it does NOT allow setting the uploading speed zero
when downloading BitTorrent files!
It is suggested that you use transmission to download BitTorrent files.

## [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) + [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en)

## Command-line Tools

### aria2

`aria2` is a high speed general purpose command-line downloading tool.
Notice that `aria2` supports BitTorrent as well.

### youtube-dl

The best command-line tool for downloading videos from YouTube.

### wget

### curl

## Misc

3. mechanize, Selenium, iMacros (auto download solutions)
6. SubDownloader (download/upload subtitles of movies)
