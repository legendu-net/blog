wajig apt-get, dpkg,


use alien or rpm to install rpm packages, wajig install alien; sudo alien -i *.rpm
```
dpkg -S $(which free)
```
Apt-get有问题时可以试试dpkg,
apt-get worries about dependencies but dpkg not,
so then dependency is broken,
you can use dpkg to install/remove packages

$ aptitude why libpng12-0

apt-mark manual
