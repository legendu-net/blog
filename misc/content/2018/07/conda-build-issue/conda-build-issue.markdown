I encountered an issue building the package
[sqlalchemy-teradata](https://pypi.org/project/sqlalchemy-teradata/).
There are a few related issues:
[issues/2790](https://github.com/conda/conda-build/issues/2790),
[issues/2826](https://github.com/conda/conda-build/issues/2826).
It seems that the recipe uses an outdated URL.
Change the URL to 
[this one](https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/13/ba/bd5ebedd251630a822cfa2ad819caa99f6b494726aa05c8ef69bbb39330e/sqlalchemy_teradata-0.1.0.dev0.tar.gz)
resolves the issue.



## Build a Conda Package

[Building conda packages from scratch](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs.html)
has detailed instructions on how to build a conda package from scratch.
In most situations,
you can simplify the building process with the help of `conda skeleton`.
Please refer to 
[Building conda packages with conda skeleton](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs-skeleton.html)
on how to use build a conda package using conda skeleton.
