## Serialization

1. Pickle is preferred to marshall.

2. Use Parquet for pandas DataFrame.

pickle: geneal purpose serialization/deserialization which supports almost all Python objects. 

Parquet (via PyArrow): specific for DataFrame objects. 

JSON: safe, human readable but limited to simple data types in Python.

## functools.lru_cache

## cachetools

## diskcache sounds like a good options!!!

DiskCache: Disk Backed Cache

## pickle 

pickle is a Python object serialization package. 

## shelve 

shelve is a package for persisting Python object 

## joblib

`joblib` is a package for running Python functions as pipeline jobs.
It supports transparent disk-caching of functions and lazy re-evaluation (memoize pattern).


## memcached & pymemcache

https://pypi.org/project/pymemcache/

http://memcached.org/

Free & open source, high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, generic in nature, 
but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load.
