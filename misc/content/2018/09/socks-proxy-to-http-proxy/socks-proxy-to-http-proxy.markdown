## Convert Socks Proxy to HTTP Proxy

Polipo is a tool that can convert a socks proxy to a HTTP proxy.
However this might not be needed
as many tools directly accepts a socks proxy as a HTTP/HTTPS proxy.
For example, 
if you have a socks5 proxy at `localhost:1080`,
you can pass `socks5://localhost:1080` to tools that require a HTTP/HTTPS proxy.

```Bash
# install polipo
wajig search polipo

# create a http proxy at 8123 using the socks proxy
polipo socksParentProxy=localhost:1080
```
