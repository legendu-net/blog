## [PySnooper](https://github.com/cool-RR/PySnooper)

A poor man's tool for debugging which is much better than print.

## unittest vs pytest

1. `unitest` is the official unit testing tool in Python
    and thus has better support and integration with other tools generally speaking. 
    However, 
    `pytest` is more concise than unittest and makes unit testing more efficiency.

## Doctest 

## hypothesis

## Coverage

## Mock and pytest Fixtures

## Flake8 vs MyPy vs pylint 

1. Flake8 focus on logical errors rather than stylistic errors.
    It strives to reduce false positives.

2. `mypy` does the best on type hint.

3. `pylint` performs deeper analysis and thus is slower.

To sum up,
I'd try the tools in the following order
`Flake8 > mypy > pylint`.
