## Installation 

### Ubuntu

apt-get install krb5-user

### CentOS

yum install -y ntp
yum install krb5-workstation krb5-libs krb5-auth-dialog


## Issues 

### kinit: Permission denied while initializing Kerberos 5 library

It is likely due to the fact that /etc/krb5.conf is not readable. 
Run the following command can help fix the issue.

    :::bash
    sudo chmod +r /etc/krb5.conf
