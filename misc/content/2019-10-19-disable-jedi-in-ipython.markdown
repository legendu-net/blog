In the meantime, looks like there is a way one can disable jedi in ipython with Completer.use_jedi: https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/options/terminal.html

Specifically you can use ipython locate profile to find your current profile directory, and edit the ipython_config.py to add c.IPCompleter.use_jedi = False


In jupyter just run a cell with the following contents %config IPCompleter.use_jedi = False
