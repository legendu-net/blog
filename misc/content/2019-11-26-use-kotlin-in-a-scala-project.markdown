1. Methods of a Kotlin object can be called in a Scala project by `KotlinObject.INSTANCE.methodToCall()`

2. You might need to provide the Kotlin standard library `kotlin-stdlib.jar`
    in order to run the compiled JAR. 
    One way to avoid this is to compile a fat/uber JAR 
    that contains all dependencies (including `kotlin-stdlib.jar`).

##. Use Kotlin in Spark/Scala
