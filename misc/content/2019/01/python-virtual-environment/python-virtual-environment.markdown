1. `venv` is preferred for managing virtual environments in Python3. 

2. When developing a Python project,
    it is recommended that you use poetry to manage the project
    which helps managing virtual environments too,
    so that you don't have to managing virtual environments by yourself.

The discussion below is specifically for `venv`.

## Installation on Ubuntu

```bash
wajig install python3-venv
```

## Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv /path/to/your/environment
```
The `venv` module provides several parameters to control the behavior of the virtual environment to be created.
```
$ python3 -m venv -h
usage: venv [-h] [--system-site-packages] [--symlinks | --copies] [--clear]
            [--upgrade] [--without-pip] [--prompt PROMPT]
            ENV_DIR [ENV_DIR ...]

Creates virtual Python environments in one or more target directories.

positional arguments:
  ENV_DIR               A directory to create the environment in.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --system-site-packages
                        Give the virtual environment access to the system
                        site-packages dir.
  --symlinks            Try to use symlinks rather than copies, when symlinks
                        are not the default for the platform.
  --copies              Try to use copies rather than symlinks, even when
                        symlinks are the default for the platform.
  --clear               Delete the contents of the environment directory if it
                        already exists, before environment creation.
  --upgrade             Upgrade the environment directory to use this version
                        of Python, assuming Python has been upgraded in-place.
  --without-pip         Skips installing or upgrading pip in the virtual
                        environment (pip is bootstrapped by default)
  --prompt PROMPT       Provides an alternative prompt prefix for this
                        environment.
```
The virtual environment can be updated by running the module command again 
with the desired combination of parameters.
For example, 
suppose a virtual environment is created using the command `python3 -m venv /path/to/your/environment`,
you can make it inherit system site-packages by running the following command.
```bash
python3 -m venv --system-site-packages venv
```

## Activate the Virtual Environment

```bash
source <DIR>/bin/activate
# or 
. <DIR>/bin/activate
```

## Use the Virtual Environment in PyCharm

1. Click on the `PyCharm` menu.

2. Click on `Preferences...`.

3. Select `Project Interpreter` in the left panel under `Project`.

4. If no virtual environment is configured for PyCharm, 
    you can select `Using Existing Virtual Environment` 
    and then choose the Python executable in the virtual environment directory (e.g., `venv/bin/python`).
