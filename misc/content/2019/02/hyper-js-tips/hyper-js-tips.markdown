## General Tips

1. Updating the environment variable `SHELL` (using the command `chsh`)
    to change the default shell doesn't work for Hyper.
    You have to set the default shell for Hyper in its configuration file directly.
    For more details,
    please refer to

* Cmd+Option+Number navigates directly to a window.

* **Cmd+Option+Arrow keys navigate among split panes.**

* **Cmd+] and Cmd+[ navigates among split panes in order of use.**
