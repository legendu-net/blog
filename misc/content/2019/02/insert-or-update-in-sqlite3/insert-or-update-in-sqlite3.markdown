**Note: UPSERT does NOT work with virtual table in SQLite3 currently!**


The UPSERT clause (following PostgreSQL syntax)
is supported in SQLite 3.24.0+.

    :::sql
    INSERT INTO players (
        user_name, age
    ) VALUES (
        'steven', 32
    ) ON CONFLICT (user_name) DO UPDATE
    SET age=excluded.age
    ;

For older versions of SQLite3,
you can use `INSERT or REPLACE` clause together with the trick of embedded subselects 
to keep original value of fields of the existing rows.
