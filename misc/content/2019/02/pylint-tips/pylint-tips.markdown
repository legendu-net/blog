## Tips and Traps 

[Optional Pylint checkers in the extensions module](https://docs.pylint.org/en/1.6.0/extensions.html#optional-pylint-checkers-in-the-extensions-module)

## Message Control

1. Show ERROR messages only.

        :::bash 
        pylint -E some_script.py

2. Show ERROR and WARNING messages only.

        :::bash 
        pylint --disable=R,C some_script.py

3. Disable warning associated with a specific line.

        :::bash
        proc = sp.run(cmd, shell=True)  # pylint: disable=W1510

## Configuration

It is suggessted that you configure pylint using `pyproject.toml`.
Below is an example.
```
[tool.pylint.master]
unsafe-load-any-extension=no
extension-pkg-whitelist=numpy,cv2

[tool.pylint.typecheck]
ignored-classes=Fysom,MyClass
```

### Similar Lines

Similar lines detection has a high chance of yielding false positives.
It is suggested that you either set `min-similarity-lines` to a large value
or disable check of similar lines.
Please refer to the issue
[The duplicate-code (R0801) can't be disabled](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/214)
for more discussions.

```
[tool.pylint.similarities]
min-similarity-lines=11
ignore-docstrings=yes
ignore-comments=yes
ignore-imports=yes
```
