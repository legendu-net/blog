## On a Sinsgle Machine

### SSH

1. The pipeline command is run locally.
    If you want the pipeline command to run remotely, 
    place the whole command to be run remotely in double/single quotes.
    For example, 
    the command below SSH into into a Hadoop client through a proxy configured by proxychains,
    prints the content of a text file and then count the number of lines in the file.

        :::bash
        proxychains ssh client_ip /apache/hadoop/bin/hdfs dfs -cat adset_id/adset_id_642.txt | wc -l

    The `wc -l` command is run locally instead of running on the Hadoop client.
    Since proxychains prints out some information too, 
    the `wc -l` will over count the number of lines in the text file.
    The correct way is count the number of lines on the Hadoop client instead of counting locally.
    A simple way is to place the whole command to be run on the Hadoop client in double/singls quotes.
    Below is an illustration.

        :::bash
        proxychains ssh client_ip '/apache/hadoop/bin/hdfs dfs -cat adset_id/adset_id_642.txt | wc -l'

### [paramiko/paramiko](https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko)

[paramiko/paramiko](https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko)
is a pure Python implementation of SSHv2. 
It is a great tool to interact with a remote server in Python.

### [asyncssh](https://github.com/ronf/asyncssh)

### [ssh2-python](https://github.com/ParallelSSH/ssh2-python)
[ssh2-python](https://github.com/ParallelSSH/ssh2-python)
is a super fast Python SSH library based on `libssh2` C library.

### [sshtunnel](https://github.com/pahaz/sshtunnel)

## On a Cluster of Machines

### [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible)

### [parallel-ssh](https://github.com/ParallelSSH/parallel-ssh)

Asynchronous parallel SSH client library.
Run SSH commands over many (hundreds/hundreds of thousands) 
number of servers asynchronously and with minimal system load on the client host.

### [ClusterSSH](https://github.com/duncs/clusterssh)

### [fabric](https://github.com/fabric/fabric/)

Ansible is a better alternative than fabric.
