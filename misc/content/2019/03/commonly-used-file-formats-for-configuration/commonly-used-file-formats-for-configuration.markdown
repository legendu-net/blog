Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author.

1. JSON is more commonly used for application data and configurations  
    which are not intended to be read by human directly.

2. TOML and YAML are more popular for application configurations 
    which are maintained by human directly.
    Both of them supports comments (in contract to JSON)
    which improves readability.

## JSON

[jsonnet](https://github.com/google/jsonnet)
is the data templating language.

## [YAML](https://yaml.org/)

## [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml)
