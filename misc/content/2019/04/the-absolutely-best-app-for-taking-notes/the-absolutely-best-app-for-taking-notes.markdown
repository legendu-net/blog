I have tried lots of notes taking applications in the past. 
The best turns out to be GitHub!

## pocket

## basket

## tomboy

## a note app written by myself

## EverNote

1. Evernote sounds like a good option for Windows/Mac users.

2. [Tusk](https://champloohq.github.io/tusk/) is a desktop client for EverNote.

3. NixNote (3rd party cross-platform client for EverNote)

2. Zim Capture
