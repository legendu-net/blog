## Tax

### ESPP

Please refer to the section "US tax considerations" on the page 
[Understanding employee stock purchase plans](https://us.etrade.com/knowledge/library/stock-plans/employee-stock-purchase-plan)
for details.
In short, 
you want to have qualifying dispositions which requires:

- The disposition occurs more than two years after the grant date, and
- The disposition occurs more than one year after the purchase date

### RSU

1. The way to cover tax for RSU can be updated at https://us.etrade.com/etx/sp/stockplan/#/myAccount/planElections/stockElections.
    You might not be able to update it for 2 reasons.
    First, 
    some company use the default way (sell to cover) and does not allow employees to change it.
    Second,
    even if you company allows you to update the way to cover tax,
    you have to wait for an open time window to update it.

When RSU shares vest, 
shares are withheld and sold to cover your tax commitment. 
The percentage withheld is dictated by your employer typically to match how your bonus are taxed. 
They deliver those instructions to us and we must comply. 
You can view this for yourself in the Release of Confirmation 
by going to "Stock Plans" >> "Holdings" and expanding the blue arrow next to the grant date. 
You'll see "View Confirmation of Release" below the grant details. 
Generally when you sell ESPP no tax is paid upon selling them. 
However, 
coming tax season we will provide you a tax form. Where you can then work with an accountant or tax advisor on how to report that.
