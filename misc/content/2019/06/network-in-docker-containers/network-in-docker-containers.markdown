1. DNS is a common issue in Docker containers, 
  especially behind a corporate firewall.
  While the Linux way of handling DNS is to configure the file `/etc/resolv.conf` 
  (or via other related configuration files or tools),
  the Docker way is to pass DNS servers via the option `--dns`
  (which will be added to `/etc/resolv.conf`) 
  when starting the Docker container.
  Multiple DNS servers can be passed using multiple `--dsn` options.


2. Due to possible DNS issues in Docker containers, 
  it is suggested that you use IP addresses instead of URL names where possible. 
  Notably, `127.0.0.1` is preferred over `localhost` in various configure files (e.g., ProxyChains).

If you set up http_proxy, https_proxy and restart the Docker daemon, 
it should work.
