Neo4j is the world’s leading Graph Database. 
It is a high performance graph store with all the features expected of a mature and robust database, 
like a friendly query language and ACID transactions. 
The programmer works with a flexible network structure of nodes and relationships rather than static tables — yet enjoys all the benefits of enterprise-quality database. 
For many applications, Neo4j offers orders of magnitude performance benefits compared to relational DBs.
