## Selenium

Selenium is a great web automation tool!

[Here](https://hub.docker.com/u/selenium)
are official Docker images for selenium.

## [playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright)

Node.js library to automate Chromium, Firefox and WebKit with a single API https://playwright.dev

## [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer)

## UI Vision

## iMacros

## SikuliX 
SikuliX is able to automate anything visual 
but it is hard to scale and not reliable.
