You can use the following command in SpaceVim to disable the `checkers` layer temporarily.

    :::vim
    let g:spacevim_lint_on_save = 0

If you want to disable the `checkers` layer permanently,
add the following lines into your `init.toml` file.

    [[layers]]
    name = "checkers"
    enable = fals

Note that language server protocol (LSP) plugins are better alternatives to the `checkers` layer.
