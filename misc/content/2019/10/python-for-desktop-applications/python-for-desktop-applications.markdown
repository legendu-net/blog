## Simple Python Packages for GUI Applications

### [Tkinter](http://www.legendu.net/misc/blog/use-tkinter-to-build-gui-applications-in-python/)

### [DearPyGui](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui)
[DearPyGui](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui)
Dear PyGui is a simple to use (but powerful) Python GUI framework. 
Dear PyGui provides a wrapping of [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) 
which simulates a traditional retained mode GUI (as opposed to Dear ImGui's immediate mode paradigm).
Dear PyGui is fundamentally different than other Python GUI frameworks. 
Under the hood, Dear PyGui uses the immediate mode paradigm and your computer's GPU 
to facilitate extremely dynamic interfaces. 

### [Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey)
turns (almost) any Python command line program 
into a full GUI application with one line.

### [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI)
creates custom layout GUI's simply.

## Solutions based on Qt

### PyQt5

### PySide2

### [fbs](https://github.com/mherrmann/fbs)

## Solutions Based on Chromium/Electron

[PLYNTH](https://www.plynth.net/)

## GUI Automation

[PyAutoGUI](https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui)
is a cross-platform GUI automation Python module for human beings. 
Used to programmatically control the mouse & keyboard.
