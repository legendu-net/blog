`pyenv` lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python. 
It's simple, unobtrusive, and follows the UNIX tradition of single-purpose tools that do one thing well.

## Install pyenv

    :::bash
    curl https://pyenv.run | bash

## Usage 

1. Install a specific version of Python.

        :::bash
        pyenv install 3.7.8 

2. Use a specific version of Python.

        :::bash
        pyenv local 3.7.8

3. Uninstall a specific version of Python 

        :::bash 
        pyenv uninstall 3.7.8 

## Tips & Traps

1. Precedence of versions of Python are defined in `$HOME/.pyenv/version`.
    Place the version of Python that you want to use in the first line of the file.

2. The root directory of pyenv is controled by the environment variable `$PYENV_ROOT`. 
    You can report the root directory of pyenv by running the command `pyenv root`.
