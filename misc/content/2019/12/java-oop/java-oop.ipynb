    "## Tips and Traps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A static method cannot be abstract in Java. \n",
    "    For refer to \n",
    "    [this discussion on Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/370962/why-cant-static-methods-be-abstract-in-java)\n",
    "    for rationale behind it. \n",
    "    If you need the two together, \n",
    "    what you are looking is probably singleton object with inheritance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Singleton objects are more flexible and useful than static methods in Java.\n",
    "    Please refer to [Singleton Pattern Versus Static Class](http://net-informations.com/faq/netfaq/singlestatic.htm)\n",
    "    for more details.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Override is a concept specific to methods in class in Java.\n",
    "    A variable in a class cannot be override in Java. \n",
    "    You have to either change the value of the variable to the one want in a subclass\n",
    "    (if you don't need a different type)\n",
    "    or define a variable with the same name in the subclass \n",
    "    to hide the variable in the super class \n",
    "    (if you need a different type).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The methods `hashCode` and `equals` belong closely together.\n",
    "    You should override both or neither.\n",
    "    Please refer to\n",
    "    [Java equals() and hashCode() Contracts](https://www.baeldung.com/java-equals-hashcode-contracts)\n",
    "    and\n",
    "    [Why do I need to override the equals and hashCode methods in Java?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2265503/why-do-i-need-to-override-the-equals-and-hashcode-methods-in-java)\n",
    "    for more discussions.\n",
    "    Notice that this principle applies to other OOP programming languages as well,\n",
    "    not just Java."
