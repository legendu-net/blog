Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author.
It is not meant to readers but rather for convenient reference of the author and future improvement.
**

1. All packages in a virtual environment must be managed by conda (rather than pip)
    so that it can be packe using conda-pack.

2. When using a conda-pack virtual environment with PySpark,
    the Python package `pyyspark` comes with Spark is automatically injected into PYTHONPATH
    so that users do not have to install `pyspark` into the virtual environemnt by themselves.
