## Data Version Control 

[dvc](https://dvc.org/)

[DAGsHub](https://dagshub.com/)

dvc + DAGsHub sounds like a good lightweighted way for data version control.

[dolthub](https://www.dolthub.com/) is another good way for data version control.

Data Versioning, Data Pipelines, and Data Lineage

## Model Life Cycle Tracking 

[mlflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html)
mlflow tracks every detail about a model (including training, servering, etc.)
but it seems to be a little bit complicated to use.
