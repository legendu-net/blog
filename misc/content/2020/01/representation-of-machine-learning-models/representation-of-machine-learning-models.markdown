[PMML4S](https://github.com/autodeployai/pmml4s)
is a PMML (Predictive Model Markup Language) scoring library for Scala. It provides both Scala and Java Evaluator API for PMML.

[JPMML-Evaluator](https://github.com/jpmml/jpmml-evaluator)
is a Java evaluator API for PMML.


## [Plain Old Java Object (POJO)]

H2O supports exporting models into POJO (JAR) files.

## [MLeap](https://mleap-docs.combust.ml/)

## Pickle

Some Python libraries support serializaing a model into pickle format.
