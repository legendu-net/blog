[tch-rs](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs)
is a Rust bindings for the C++ API of PyTorch.

## [linfa](https://github.com/rust-ml/linfa)

## [BastionAI](https://github.com/mithril-security/bastionai)
BastionAI is a confidential deep learning framework 
that enables data scientists to train their models on sensitive data, 
while ensuring the data providers no third party will have access to these.

## [tract](https://github.com/sonos/tract)
[tract](https://github.com/sonos/tract)
is a Neural Network inference toolkit developed in Rust. 
It can read Tensorflow 1, ONNX or NNEF, 
optimize them and run data through them.
