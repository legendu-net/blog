[huggingface/transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
has PyTorch implementation of transfomer based models 
(such as 
[BERT](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/src/transformers/modeling_bert.py)
and
[DistilBERT](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/src/transformers/modeling_distilbert.py)
).
