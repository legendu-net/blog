User-based Filtering (Memory-based Filtering)

Item-based Filtering (Content-based Filtering)

Non-negative Matrix Factorization

Neural Matrix Factorization

Variational Autoencoder

Hybrid


New methods like VAE, AE, or Deep Collaborative outperform classical methods like NMF on the NDCG metric. Non-linear probabilistic models such as variational autoencoders enable us to go beyond the limited modeling capacity of linear factor models.
