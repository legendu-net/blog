## Frameworks

The article 
[A Comparison of Reinforcement Learning Frameworks: Dopamine, RLLib, Keras-RL, Coach, TRFL, Tensorforce, Coach and more](https://winderresearch.com/a-comparison-of-reinforcement-learning-frameworks-dopamine-rllib-keras-rl-coach-trfl-tensorforce-coach-and-more/)
has a comprehensive comparison of diferent reinforcement learning frameworks. 
Based on the author's opinion,
[OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym)
and 
Apache Ray 
[RLLib](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/tree/master/rllib)
are the best 2 libraries.

[On Choosing a Deep Reinforcement Learning Library](https://medium.com/data-from-the-trenches/choosing-a-deep-reinforcement-learning-library-890fb0307092)
recommends Stable Baselines and TF-Agents.
