## PIL.Image.Image.crop

Notice that the bounding box is inclusive/EXCLUSIVE like the `range` function.

## PIL.Image.Image.resize

1. `img.resize(img.size)` returns a new copy and the new copy is not necessarily the same as the original one.

2. `Image.resize` might return different results in different versions of Pillow.
    To ensure that you get the same result,
    make sure to have the same version of Pillow,
    and best to use a Docker environment to ensure identical environment.

## Mask (Image) in Pillow

1. A Mask (image) in Pillow must be a binary image.
