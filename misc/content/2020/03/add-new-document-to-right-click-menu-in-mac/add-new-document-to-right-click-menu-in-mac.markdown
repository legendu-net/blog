[Right Click to Create New File on macOS](https://filipmolcik.com/new-file-mac-os/)
Automator
This solution is stupid. 
You must right click on a file/folder in order for `Quick Action` to show up in the menu.
But what if I want to create a new document in an empty directory?

[How To Create New Files From The macOS Right-Click Context Menu](https://www.addictivetips.com/mac-os/how-to-create-new-files-from-the-macos-right-click-context-menu/)
This solution is a no-go for me as I don't pay for apps.

Another possible way is to install the opensource application
[OpenInTerminal](https://github.com/Ji4n1ng/OpenInTerminal).
It helps you quickly open the currently directory in terminal.
You can then use create a new file from comamnd-line.
