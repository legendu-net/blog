1. The `Module.__call__` method register all hooks and call the method `Module.forward`. 
    In short, 
    when you train the model you should use the method `forward`,
    while when you test the model during training 
    or when you do prediction using a well trained model, 
    you should use the method `__call__`. 
    `model.__call__(data)` is equivalent to `model(data)`.
