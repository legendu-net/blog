## Abort trap: 6 when using `pip3 search`

The issue is due to to `pyopenssl` using old dependencies. 
It can be fixed by removing the Python package `cryptography` package
and then upgrading `cryptography` to version 2.8.

1. Find the location of the Python package cryptography.

        :::bash
        pip3 show cryptograph

2. Remove the whole package directory.

        :::bash
        sudo rm -rf /path/to/cryptograph

3. Reinstall the latest version of `cryptograph`.

        :::bash
        pip3 install cryptograph
