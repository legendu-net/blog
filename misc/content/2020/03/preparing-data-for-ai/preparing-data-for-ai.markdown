## General Tips

1. When you label individual images,
    it is better to use numerical labels 
    (even though text labels are easier to understand)
    so that you can avoid mapping between numbers (use for training)
    and text labels (for human understanding) all the time.

2. If you have no labeled data to start at all,
    do NOT hurry to jumping into labeling yet. 
    Check the article
