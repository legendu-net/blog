The macOS has some system applications (e.g., Numbers, Keynotes, etc.) come installed by default.
You cannot uninstall them from `Application` in `Finder`.
However,
there's one way to remove those applications.

1. About This Mac

2. Click on Storage.

3. Click on the "Manage..." button.

4. Select "Applications" in the left panel.

5. Select the application you want remove on the right panel.

6. Click the "Delete..." button on the bottom-right corner.

7. Repeat steps 5-6 to remove more applications.
