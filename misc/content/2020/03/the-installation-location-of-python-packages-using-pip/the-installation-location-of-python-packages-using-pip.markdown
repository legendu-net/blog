When installing a Python package using `pip` 
without using `sudo` or the `root` user,
the package is installed into the user's local directory at 
`~/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages` (using Python 3.7 as example).
if `sudo` or the `root` user is used with `pip`,
then the package is installed to the system-wide location at 
`/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages` (using Python 3.7 as example).
One potentially very tricky thing that 
the above statement applies to direct shell commands only.
Let's say that you run a Python program as a regular user `dclong` with out `sudo`,
and you use the `subprocess` module to revoke a shell command like below.

    :::python
    import subprocess as sp
    sp.run("sudo pip3 install pandas", shell=True)

The Python package `pandas` will be installed to the local directory of the user `dclong`
even if `sudo` is used in this case!!
If you have used the `root` user to run the above Python script,
the Python package `pandas` will be installed to the local directory 
(`/root/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages`) of the `root` user.
Instead of invoking a `sudo pip3 install ...` in the Python script, 
you can just invoking `pip3 install ...` in thee Python script 
and run your Python script with sudo.
This fixes the tricky issue.

There are a few options to give users fine control on the destination directory 
to install Python packages.

## --user

Install to the Python user install directory for your platform. 
Typically `~/.local/`, 
or `%APPDATA%Python` on Windows. 
(See the Python documentation for site.USER_BASE for full details.)
Generally speaking,
you do not have to specify this option manually 
as Python packages are installed to the user's local directory by default
unless `sudo` or the `root` user is used.
The `--user` can be useful if you install a Python package using `setup.py`.

    :::bash
    python setup.py install --user

## --root <dir>

Install everything relative to this alternate root directory.

## --prefix <dir>

Installation prefix where lib, bin and other top-level folders are placed

## -t, --target <dir>

Install packages into <dir>. 
By default this will not replace existing files/folders in <dir>. 
Use --upgrade to replace existing packages in <dir> with new versions.
