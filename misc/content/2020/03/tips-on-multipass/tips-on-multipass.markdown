It is suggested that you use LXD instead of Multipass.
LXD is more lightweight than Multipass and does not require a CPU 
which supports virtualization.

## General Tips

1. You can consider Multipass as a lightweight Ubuntu specific Docker equivalence. 

## Find available images

multipass find

## Launch a fresh instance of the current Ubuntu LTS

multipass launch ubuntu

## Check out the running instances

multipass list

## Learn more about the VM instance you just launched

multipass info dancing-chipmunk

## Sharing data with the instance

The recommended way to share data between your host and the instance is the mount command:

    :::bash
    multipass mount $HOME keen-yak
    multipass info keen-yak
    …
    Mounts:         /home/ubuntu => /home/ubuntu
    From this point on /home/ubuntu will be available inside the instance. Use umount to unmount it again and you can change the target by passing it after the instance name:

    :::bash
    multipass umount keen-yak
    multipass mount $HOME keen-yak:/some/path
    multipass info keen-yak                
    …
    Mounts:         /home/michal => /some/path
    You can also use copy-files to just copy files around - prefix the path with <name>: if it’s inside an instance:

    :::bash
    multipass copy-files keen-yak:/etc/crontab keen-yak:/etc/fstab .

## Connect to a running instance

multipass shell dancing-chipmunk

## Run commands inside an instance from outside

multipass exec dancing-chipmunk -- lsb_release -a

## Stop an instance to save resources

multipass stop dancing-chipmunk

## Delete the instance
multipass delete dancing-chipmunk
