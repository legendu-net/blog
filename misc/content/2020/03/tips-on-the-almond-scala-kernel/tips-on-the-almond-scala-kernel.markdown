1. `kernel.silent(true)` 
    supress outputs of cells.


2. Currently each line in a cell have an output,
    which is messy.
    There are 2 ways to avoid this.

        :::scala
        val resObj = {
            ...
            ...
        }

        {{
            ...
            ...
        }}
