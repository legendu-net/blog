TVM is an open deep learning compiler stack for CPUs, GPUs, and specialized accelerators. 
It aims to close the gap between the productivity-focused deep learning frameworks, 
and the performance- or efficiency-oriented hardware backends. TVM provides the following main features:

- Compilation of deep learning models in Keras, MXNet, PyTorch, Tensorflow, CoreML, DarkNet into minimum deployable modules on diverse hardware backends.
- Infrastructure to automatic generate and optimize tensor operators on more backend with better performance.

In short, 
TVM to deep learning is kind of like LLVM to programming languages.
