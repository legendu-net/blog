**

1. PyTorch uses pickle to serialize and deserialize objects.

2. The PyTorch convention is 
    to use the file extension `.pt` or `.pth` for saving model (or its parameters)
    and use the file extension `.tar` for saving checkpoints.

3. It is preferred to save model parameters rather than the whole model.
