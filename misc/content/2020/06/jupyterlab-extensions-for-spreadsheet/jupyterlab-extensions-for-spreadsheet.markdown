### [jupyterlab-spreadsheet](https://github.com/quigleyj97/jupyterlab-spreadsheet)

The extension [jupyterlab-spreadsheet](https://github.com/quigleyj97/jupyterlab-spreadsheet)
provides a way to view Excel files. 
This makes it possible to work with simple Excel file in JupyterLab 
with the help of the Python library
