## Comparison

1. Compared to Markdown, 
    RestructuredText is more fully-featured, much more standardized and uniform,
    and has built-in support for extensions.
    However, 
    ReStructuredText is also criticized for its complex and confusing syntax.
    The toolchains for ReStructuredText (Sphinx) is also more complicated to use 
    than Markdown equivalent tools.
    MySt is an extension from [CommonMarkdown](https://commonmark.org/) 
    with goodies introduced from RestructuredText.
    The [jupyter-book](https://github.com/executablebooks/jupyter-book)
    project supports MySt syntax.
