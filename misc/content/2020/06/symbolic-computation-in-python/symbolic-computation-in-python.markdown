## Mathematica 

The best one that I've ever used, but commercial unfortunately.

## SAGE

A good open souce alternative to Mathematica. 
Maxima (a symbolic-centric package) is integrated into SAGE.


## Maxima 

A more symbolic-centric package that is an open source development of the old commercial Macsyma code.
