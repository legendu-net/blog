## Mathematica 

The best one that I've ever used, but commercial unfortunately.

## [sympy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy)

A computer algebra system written in pure Python

## [Maxima](https://maxima.sourceforge.io/)

A more symbolic-centric package that is an open source development of the old commercial Macsyma code.
## [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/)

A good open souce alternative to Mathematica. 
sympy, Maxima, etc. are integrated into SageMath.

## Which One to Use

1. If you need the most advanced symbolic computation support 
    and can afford to pay,
    use Mathematica.

2. If you want a opensource alternative to Mathematica,
    use SageMath.

3. If you need a symbolic computation library, 
    use sympy.
