    "1. [Type hints cheat sheet (Python 3)](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html#built-in-types)\n",
    "    is a quick cheat sheet showing how the PEP 484 type annotation notation represents various common types in Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Notice that the annotation on List and Tuple are different. \n",
    "    `List[T]` stands for a variable length list of elements with type `T`.\n",
    "    However,\n",
    "    `Tuple[T]` stands for a tuple with 1 element of type `T`.\n",
    "    To specify a variable-length tuple of homogeneous type, use literal ellipsis, e.g. `Tuple[int, ...]`. \n",
    "    A plain Tuple is equivalent to `Tuple[Any, ...]`, and in turn to tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use `typing.TextIO` and `typing.BinaryIO` for file handler object.\n"

    "2. Both pytype and mypy can be used to check code based using type information. \n",
    "    pytype is superior than mype for a few reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Pytype uses inference instead of gradual typing. \n",
    "        This means it will infer types on code even when the code has no type hints on it. \n",
    "        So it can detect issues with code like this, which other type checkers would miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Pytype is lenient instead of strict. \n",
    "        That means it allows all operations that succeed at runtime and don\u2019t contradict annotations. \n",
    "        For instance, this code will pass as safe in pytype, but fail in other type checkers, \n",
    "        which assign types to variables as soon as they are initialized."
