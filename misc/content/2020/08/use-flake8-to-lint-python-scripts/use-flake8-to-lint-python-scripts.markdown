## Configration

It is suggested that you put the configuration into a file named `.flake8` 
in the root directory of your project.
When flake8 supports `pyproject.toml` later,
it is best to configure flake8 in `pyproject.toml`.
Below is an example of configuration.

    :::text
    [flake8]
    ignore = C901,E501,E251,E124,E125,E722,E261,E265,W291,W292,W293
    exclude = __init__.py,docs/source/conf.py,old,build,dist,.git,__pycache__
    max-complexity = 10

Please refer to the following link for an example of configuration.
