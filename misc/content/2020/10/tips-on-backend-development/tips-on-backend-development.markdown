## API

- RESTful
- GraphQL

## Java Backend Frameworks

### [spring-framework](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework)

[spring-framework](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework)
Spring provides everything required beyond the Java programming language 
for creating enterprise applications for a wide range of scenarios and architectures. 

## Kotlin Backend Frameworks

[Using Kotlin for Server-side Development](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/server-overview.html)

## NodeJS (JavaScript/TypeScript)

### [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
[express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node.

### [nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest)
[nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest)
is a framework for building efficient, 
scalable Node.js server-side applications. 
It uses modern JavaScript, 
is built with TypeScript (preserves compatibility with pure JavaScript) 
and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), 
FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).
Under the hood, 
Nest makes use of Express, 
but also, provides compatibility with a wide range of other libraries, 
like e.g. Fastify, allowing for easy use of the myriad third-party plugins which are available.


Notice that 
[nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest)
is different from 
[Nuxt](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js)
and
[Next](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/)
which are for frontend web application 
leveraging Vue and React respectively.

## Python Backend Frameworks

### [Django](https://github.com/django/django)
[Django](https://github.com/django/django)
is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

### [FastApi](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi)
[FastApi](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi)
is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs 
with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
It is a much better alternative than Flask!

### [Tornado](https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado)
[Tornado](https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado)
is a Python web framework and **asynchronous** networking library.
By using non-blocking network I/O, 
Tornado can scale to tens of thousands of open connections, 
making it ideal for long polling, WebSockets, 
and other applications that require a long-lived connection to each user.

### [bottle](https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle)
[bottle](https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle)
is a fast and simple micro-framework for python web-applications.

### [Pyre](https://github.com/Project-Dream-Weaver/Pyre)
[Pyre](https://github.com/Project-Dream-Weaver/Pyre)

A fast Python http server inspired by japronto written in rust.

### Flask

## Rust
