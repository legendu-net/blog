## Misc

1. HTML is not case sensitive, 
    but it's suggested that you alway use lower case for tags.

1. `<!-- ... -->` comment 

2. always use `<!DOCTYPE>`


1. code is for verbatim code while `<script> ... </script>` 
    is for scripting code that will acutally run.

3. you'd better use percent for width when formating paragraphs and so on, 
    this is more portable `<p style="width:79%"> ... </p>`

1. it seems that figcaption in html5 cannot align correctly, must rely on div to align, 
    but only center works perfect.

4. no difference between double vs single quotes in HTML
