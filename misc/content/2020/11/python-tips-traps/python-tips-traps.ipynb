    "\n",
    "1. Restrict the types of objects that your function/method can be applied to \n",
    "  and throw a (ValueError) exception when a wrong type is provided.\n",
    "  This helps minimize surprisings.\n",
    "  If you must make a function accepts 2 (or more) customized types of objects, \n",
    "  it is best to make them have similar duck types. \n",
    "  For example, \n",
    "  one object has members `mem1` and `mem2` (which are used in the function),\n",
    "  instead of representing the 2nd type of object as a tuple (of 2 elements)\n",
    "  it is better to define a class to match interfaces of the first type of object \n",
    "  so that implementation of the function is simple and concise. \n",
    "  Noticce that dataclass is a good way to implement simple classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. AVOID returning objects of different types from a Python function/method.\n",
    "  \n",
    "7. Almost all modern programming languages follow the convention\n",
    "  of not returnting anything (or in another words, retun void, None, etc.)\n",
    "  from a mutator method so that you cannot chain on a mutator method.\n",
    "  Functional programming languages enough chaining on methods\n",
    "  as they often have immutable objects and the methods return new objects\n",
    "  rather than changing the original objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Python functions (except lambda functions) do not automatically return value\n",
    "  unlike functional programming languages.\n",
    "  Forgotting a `return` statement is a common mistake in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. You cannot use `return` to return result from a generator function.\n",
    "  Instead a `return` behaves like raising a StopIteration.\n",

    "    Since a list in Python is mutable,\n",
