## JDK commands
Thread dump: jstack jvm_pid > <file_name>     (use -F if not responding)

Memory dump: jmap -dump:live,format=b,file=<file_name>.hprof jvm_pid

Heap status:  jmap -heap jvm_pid

GC status: jstat -gccause -h 50 -t jvm_pid 2s  (refresh every 2s, show header every 50 rows, show time stamp)

You can use command jps to find out all pids of currently running jvm process.

Heap dump analysis tool

If MAT can't load your file, you can use jhat to analyze. Then you use your browser to go to 8080 port.

jhat -port 8080 129546.hprof

JXRay is a paid smart heap dump analyzer that other than analyzing the heap dump, it'll also make concrete suggestions on how to fix the problems that it finds.

It's very easy to set up and run, an at the moment (10/2020), it offers free trial of 7 heap analysis for one email.
