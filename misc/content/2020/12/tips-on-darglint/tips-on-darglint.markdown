## Tips and Traps

1. It is suggested that you avoid using `darglint` directly,
    but instead you can use `flake8`
    which will automatically call `darglint` if it exists.

2. Improperly escaped `\n` causes `darglint` fail to parse the docstring.

## Configuration 

It is suggested that you place configuration into a file named `.darglint` 
under the root directory of your project.
When darglint supports `pyproject.toml`, 
the configuration should be moved into `pyproject.toml`.
Below is an example of configuration.

    :::text
    [darglint]
    docstring_style=sphinx
    message_template={path}:{line}: {msg_id}: {msg}
