## Visual Studio Code

1. The 
    [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer)
    extension seems to be a good option.

2. [Rust extenstion (rust-lang.rust)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust) 
    is another posssible extension for Rust
    but does not work as well as 
    [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer)
    .

## IntelliJ
