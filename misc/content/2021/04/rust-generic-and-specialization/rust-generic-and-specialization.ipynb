    "## Tips and Traps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are 2 specialization related features `specialization` and `min_specialization` in Rust.\n",
    "    Both of them are unstable currentlly.\n",
    "    `min_specialization` implements only a subset of `specialization` but is more stable. \n",
    "    It is suggested that you use `min_specialization` \n",
    "    as `specialization` is disabled by Rust at this time.\n",
    "    Eventually, \n",
    "    `min_specialization` will be replace by `specialization` \n",
    "    (after the implementation of `specialization` stablize).\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Specialization (unstable feature) is not powerful enough. \n",
    "    It does not support specializing a generic function directly\n",
    "    but you have to do it via specilizing a method of a trait. \n",
    "    For more discussionss,\n",
