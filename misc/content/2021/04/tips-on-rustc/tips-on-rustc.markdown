[Optimizations: the speed size tradeoff](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/unsorted/speed-vs-size.html)

1. By default, 
    the Rust compiler `rustc` does no speed/size optimizations (`-C opt-level=0`).

2. `rustc` supports three levels of optimization for speed (`-C opt-level=1`, `-C opt-level=2` and `-C opt-level=3`)
    and 2 levels of optimization for size (`-C opt-level=s` and `-C opt-level=z`).

3. `rustc -O` is equivalent to `rustc -C opt-level=2`
    and `cargo build --release` uses the release profile which defaults to `-C opt-level=3`.
