## Debug Rust Using rust-gdb

## Debug Rust Using rust-lldb

## Debug Rust Using [rr](https://github.com/rr-debugger/rr)
is a lightweight tool for recording, 
replaying and debugging execution of applications (trees of processes and threads). 
Debugging extends gdb with very efficient reverse-execution, 
which in combination with standard gdb/x86 features like hardware data watchpoints, makes debugging much more fun.
