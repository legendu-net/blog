## Memory 

1. ResNet 152 can be train with 8G GPU memory,
    however,
    deeper ResNet does not fit into 8G GPU memory.

## Speed

1. Training ResNet 152 on GeForce RTX 3070 8GB is about 15x faster 
    than training it on Intel Core i9-10850K (5.2 GHz Turbo) (20-Thread) (10-Core) 3.6 GHz + 64G memory.

## Accuracy
