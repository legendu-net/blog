**Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author. Please read with your own judgement!**

1. Batch/robot accounts are much more convenient to use than personal accounts in an enterprise environment 
    as personal accounts are often required to do 2FA.

2. Availability and stability are way more important than productivity and cool technology
    in critical business applications. 
    Avoid purchasing cutting-edge technologies in those situations 
    but rather wait for new technologies to be well tested before adopting them.
