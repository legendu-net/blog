## Products 

### neo4j

### RDFox
Unique features of RDFox include the very powerful rule language (roughly equal to SPARQL query language) and incremental maintenance of materialised edges. It is also very high performance; typically orders of magnitude faster than other KGs.

### Amazon Neptune
Neptune can support very large KGs, but it doesnâ€™t support rules/reasoning, and is very slow compared to RDFox. We have a collaboration with Neptune where we use RDFox to support reasoning and fast query answering over large KGs stored in Neptune.

### TopBraid

AFAIK Top Braid has a relatively limited language (SHACL), mainly for defining constraints. RDFox can load SHACL, but it supports much more powerful rules for generating new edges.

### Allegro 

Allegro graph is a triple store, but AFAIK it has very limited support for ontologies/rules.
