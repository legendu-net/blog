There are a few crates in Rust
which provide terminal progress reporting functionalities.
The
[indicatif](https://crates.io/crates/indicatif)
crate is the best one to use.
The
[linya](https://crates.io/crates/linya)
crate is a simple no-deps alternative to indicatif.

[howudoin](https://crates.io/crates/howudoin)
provides progress reporting abstraction for Rust.
It intends to make producing and consuming progress reports simple and ergonomic. 
Importantly, 
it separates the progress producers from the consumer, 
allowing progress reports to be generated from disparate sections in a system.
