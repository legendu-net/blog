I encountered an issue with Ubuntu 20.04
on my machine.
Ubuntu crashes when I try to open settings or video players. 
After searching online,
it seems that the problem happens on multiple version of Ubuntu
instead of just Ubuntu 20.04,
and people suggest installing Nvidia's driver for machines with Nvidia GPUs. 
My machine does have a Nvidia GPU
and switching from the nouvea driver to Nvidia's proprietary driver indeed fixed the issue for me.
