The YouTube video 
[Open-Source License Explained in 5 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjN-mufsNbQ)
has very nice summary of different types of opensource licenses.

- You can use a copyleft licensed source code in your commercial software 
    under the condition to share your source code.
- You can use a weak copyleft licensed source code in your commercial software 
    under the condition to share the modified source code.
- You can use a permissive licensed source code without sharing anything.
