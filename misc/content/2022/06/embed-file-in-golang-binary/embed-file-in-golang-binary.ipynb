    "## Tips and Traps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. My understanding is that embed files are loaded into memory,\n",
    "    which means that the Go app might consume large memory if you embed a large file.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. The \"embed\" package does not work with the Gophernotes kernel. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. `.` and `..` are disallowed in the path of a embed path,\n",
    "    which means that you can only embed files in the current directory \n",
    "    or its subdirectories.\n",
    "    In another words, \n",
    "    However, \n",
    "    a embed variable can be used imported into other modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You can embed multiple files as one variable using wildcards.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You can embed a whole directory as a variable of `embed.FS`\n",
    "    and then use it access a single file as needed at runtime.\n",
    "    Below is an example of embedding a directory named `data` \n",
    "    as a `embed.FS` variable named `Data`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        //go:embed data\n",
    "        var Data embed.FS"
