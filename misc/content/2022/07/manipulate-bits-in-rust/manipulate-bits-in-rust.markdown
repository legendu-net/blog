## [bitvec](https://crates.io/crates/bitvec)
[bitvec](https://crates.io/crates/bitvec)
Addresses memory by bits, for packed collections and bitfields
bitvec provides a foundational API for bitfields in Rust. It specializes standard-library data structures (slices, arrays, and vectors of bool) to use one-bit-per-bool storage, similar to std::bitset<N> and std::vector<bool> in C++.

## [bit-iter](https://crates.io/crates/bit-iter)
[bit-iter](https://crates.io/crates/bit-iter)
Iterate forward or backwards over the positions of set bits in a word.



## [bit-vec](https://crates.io/crates/bit-vec)
[bit-vec](https://crates.io/crates/bit-vec)
A vector of bits

## [bit_field](https://crates.io/crates/bit_field)
[bit_field](https://crates.io/crates/bit_field)
Simple bit field trait providing get_bit, get_bits, set_bit, and set_bits methods for Rust's integral types.
