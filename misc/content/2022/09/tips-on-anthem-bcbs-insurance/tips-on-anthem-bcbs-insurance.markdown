## Check Whether A Care Provide Is In-network Or Not

1. Click on "Find Care" on the Anthem portal 
    and if a care provide populates then it in network. 

2. You may also use www.bcbs.com. 

3. Talk to a agent via chat ask for verification.

## Premera vs BCBS

Premera is the local BCBS for Washington. 
A care provider will submit all claims to the local BCBS 
and then the local BCBS will submit them to Anthem BCBS 
so that they will show on your account.
