**Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author. Please read with your own judgement!**

GraphQL
harder (compared to RESTful and gRPC) to cache.

rRPC
has the best performance 

but not cannot be used for communication between frontend and backend directly,
even thought it is doable.
