**Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author. Please read with your own judgement!**

1. Combining asynchronous code with synchronous code that can cause blocking is never a wise choice.
    When calling asynchronous code from a synchronous context, 
    use `futures::executor::block_on` and spawn the async code to a dedicated runtime, 
    because the former will block the current thread.
    On the other hand, 
    if you have to call blocking synchronous code from an asynchronous context, 
    it is recommended to use `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` 
    to execute the code on a dedicated executor that handles blocking operations.
