## Rust Dev Tools

### [cargo-show-asm](https://github.com/pacak/cargo-show-asm)
[cargo-show-asm](https://github.com/pacak/cargo-show-asm)
is a cargo subcommand showing the assembly, LLVM-IR and MIR generated for Rust code.


### [cargo-px](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/cargo-px)
[cargo-px](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/cargo-px)
is a cargo subcommand that extends cargo's capabilities when it comes to code generation.

### [cargo-binstall](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-binstall)
[cargo-binstall](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-binstall)
provides a low-complexity mechanism 
for installing rust binaries as an alternative 
to building from source (via cargo install) or manually downloading packages. 
This is intended to work with existing CI artifacts and infrastructure, 
and with minimal overhead for package maintainers.

### [cargo-info](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-info)
[cargo-info](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-info)
extends cargo to query crates.io registry for crates details.

### [cargo-careful](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-careful)
[cargo-careful](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-careful)
execute Rust code carefully, 
with extra checking along the way.

### [cargo-semver-checks](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-semver-checks)
[cargo-semver-checks](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-semver-checks)
scans your Rust crate for semver violations.

### [cargo-udeps]( https://www.legendu.net/misc/blog/find-unused-rust-deps-using-cargo-udeps )
[cargo-udeps]( https://www.legendu.net/misc/blog/find-unused-rust-deps-using-cargo-udeps )
finds unused dependencies in Cargo.toml.

### [cargo-sweep](https://github.com/holmgr/cargo-sweep)
[cargo-sweep](https://github.com/holmgr/cargo-sweep)
is a cargo subcommand for cleaning up unused build files generated by Cargo.

### [marker](https://github.com/rust-marker/marker)
[marker](https://github.com/rust-marker/marker)
is a stable linting interface for Rust. Let's make custom lints a reality.

https://crates.io/crates/vergen
Generate build, git, rustc, cargo, and sysinfo related cargo:rustc-env instructions via build.rs 
for use in your code via the env! macro or option_env! macro.

### [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt) - Format Code
[rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt)
is Rust's code (official) formatting tool.
If `rustfmt` has been installed (using `rustup component add rustfmt`),
you can run the following command to format code in a Rust project.

    cargo fmt 

Notice that `cargo fmt` might have issues with Rust code 
that are nested in many layers
and there's no good configuration to make it work.
It is suggested that you do not nest Rust code too deeply. 
This not only make things easier for `cargo fmt`
but also makes your Rust code cleaner and more readable.

### [rust-clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy)
[rust-clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy)
is a bunch of lints to catch common mistakes and improve your Rust code.

### [cargo-nextest](https://github.com/nextest-rs/nextest)

[cargo-nextest](https://github.com/nextest-rs/nextest)
is a next-generation test runner for Rust.

### [cargo-edit](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit)

[cargo-edit](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit)
is a utility for managing cargo dependencies from the command line.
It is a temporary solution before the issue
[Add cargo-add (from cargo-edit) to cargo proper](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/5586)
is resolved.

    :::bash
    cargo install cargo-edit

### [cargo-crev](https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev)
[cargo-crev](https://github.com/crev-dev/cargo-crev)
is a cryptographically verifiable code review system for the cargo (Rust) package manager.
It is an implementation of Crev as a command line tool integrated with cargo,
which helps Rust users evaluate the quality and trustworthiness of their package dependencies.

### [cargo-audit](https://github.com/RustSec/cargo-audit)
[cargo-audit](https://github.com/RustSec/cargo-audit)
is a Cargo subcommand
which audits Cargo.lock files for crates with security vulnerabilities.
It also supports CICD tools such as GitHub Actions 
(via [audit-check](https://github.com/actions-rs/audit-check))
and Travis CI.

### [rust-crate-audits](https://github.com/google/rust-crate-audits)
Google uses cargo-vet to ensure third-party Rust dependencies have been audited by Googlers or other trusted entities.
This repository automatically aggregates Google's audits from various repositories to make them easily reusable by others.

### [cargo-vet](https://github.com/mozilla/cargo-vet)
[cargo-vet](https://github.com/mozilla/cargo-vet)
is a tool to help projects ensure that third-party Rust dependencies have been audited by a trusted entity. 
It strives to be lightweight and easy to integrate.

### [cargo-generate](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate)
[cargo-generate](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate)
is a developer tool to help you get up and running quickly with a new Rust project 
by leveraging a pre-existing git repository as a template.

### [cargo-dist](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist)
[cargo-dist](https://github.com/axodotdev/cargo-dist)
is cargo build but for building final distributable artifacts and uploading them to an archive.

### [cargo-shuttle](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle)
[Shuttle]( https://www.legendu.net/misc/blog/tips-on-shuttle-for-deploying-rust-apps ) 
is a Rust-native cloud development platform that lets you deploy your Rust apps for free.


### [cargo-careful](https://github.com/RalfJung/cargo-careful)
[cargo-careful](https://github.com/RalfJung/cargo-careful)
is a tool to run your Rust code extra carefully 
-- opting into a bunch of nightly-only extra checks that help detect Undefined Behavior, 
and using a standard library with debug assertions.

### [cargo-pgo](https://github.com/Kobzol/cargo-pgo)

Cargo subcommand for optimizing binaries with PGO and BOLT.

### [cargo-hack](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-hack)
Cargo subcommand to provide various options useful for testing and continuous integration.

### [cargo-watch](https://github.com/watchexec/cargo-watch)
Cargo Watch watches over your project's source for changes, 
and runs Cargo commands when they occur.

### [dylint](https://github.com/trailofbits/dylint)
Dylint is a Rust linting tool, similar to Clippy. 
But whereas Clippy runs a predetermined, static set of lints, 
Dylint runs lints from user-specified, dynamic libraries. 
Thus, Dylint allows developers to maintain their own personal lint collections.

### [cargo-generate](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate)
[cargo-generate](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate)
is a developer tool to help you get up and running quickly

is a Cargo helper command 
which automatically creates binary Debian packages (.deb) from Cargo projects.

### [cross](https://crates.io/crates/cross)

.

### [cargo-llvm-cov](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov)
