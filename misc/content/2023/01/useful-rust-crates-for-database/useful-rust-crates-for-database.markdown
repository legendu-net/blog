## Storage
### [datenlord](https://github.com/datenlord/datenlord)
[DatenLord](https://github.com/datenlord/datenlord)
is a next-generation cloud-native distributed storage platform, 
which aims to meet the performance-critical storage needs from next-generation cloud-native applications, such as microservice, serverless, AI, etc. On one hand, DatenLord is designed to be a cloud-native storage system, which itself is distributed, fault-tolerant, and graceful upgrade. These cloud-native features make DatenLord easy to use and easy to maintain. On the other hand, DatenLord is designed as an application-orientated storage system, in that DatenLord is optimized for many performance-critical scenarios, such as databases, AI machine learning, big data. Meanwhile, DatenLord provides high-performance storage service for containers, which facilitates stateful applications running on top of Kubernetes (K8S). The high performance of DatenLord is achieved by leveraging the most recent technology revolution in hardware and software, such as NVMe, non-volatile memory, asynchronous programming, and the native Linux asynchronous IO support.
## Log Storage

openobserve
https://github.com/openobserve/openobserve
OpenObserve is a cloud native observability platform built specifically for logs, metrics, traces and analytics designed to work at petabyte scale.
🚀 10x easier, 🚀 140x lower storage cost, 🚀 high performance, 🚀 petabyte scale - Elasticsearch/Splunk/Datadog alternative for 🚀 (logs, metrics, traces).




### [parseable](https://github.com/parseablehq/parseable)
[Parseable](https://github.com/parseablehq/parseable)
is a lightweight, cloud native log observability engine. 
It can use either a local drive or S3 (and compatible stores) for backend data storage.
Parseable is written in Rust and uses Apache Arrow and Parquet as underlying data structures. 
Additionally, it uses a simple, index-free mechanism to organize and query data allowing low latency, 
and high throughput ingestion and query.

### [zincobserve](https://github.com/zinclabs/zincobserve)
[ZincObserve](https://github.com/zinclabs/zincobserve)

for logs, metrics, traces and analytics designed to work at petabyte scale.
It is very simple and easy to operate as opposed to Elasticsearch 
which requires a couple dozen knobs to understand and tune 
which you can get up and running in under 2 minutes.
It is a drop-in replacement for Elasticsearch 
if you are just ingesting data using APIs 
and searching using kibana (Kibana is not supported nor required with ZincObserve. 
ZincObserve provides its own UI which does not require separate installation unlike kibana).
