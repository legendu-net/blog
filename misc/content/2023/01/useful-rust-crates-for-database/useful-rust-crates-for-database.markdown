is a graph database written in rust.

## [oxigraph/](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph/)
[oxigraph/](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph/)
Oxigraph is a graph database implementing the SPARQL standard.
Its goal is to provide a compliant, safe, 
and fast graph database based on the RocksDB and Sled key-value stores. 
It is written in Rust. 
It also provides a set of utility functions for reading, writing, and processing RDF files.
Oxigraph is in heavy development and SPARQL query evaluation has not been optimized yet.

### [skytable](https://github.com/skytable/skytable)
[Skytable](https://github.com/skytable/skytable)
is a free and open-source NoSQL database 
that aims to provide flexible data modeling at scale. 
Simplicity, performance and flexibility are the guiding design principles.

### [bolt-rs](https://github.com/lucis-fluxum/bolt-rs)
[bolt-rs](https://github.com/lucis-fluxum/bolt-rs)
aims to provide a comprehensive set of libraries 
that allow for interaction with graph database servers 
that support the Bolt protocol, namely, Neo4j. 
This set of libraries allows interacting with servers 
supporting versions 1 through 4.1 of the protocol, 
which includes Neo4j 3.1 through 4.2.

### [neo4rs](https://github.com/yehohanan7/neo4rs)
[Neo4rs](https://github.com/yehohanan7/neo4rs)
is a Neo4j rust driver implemented using bolt specification.
This driver is compatible with neo4j 4.x versions
