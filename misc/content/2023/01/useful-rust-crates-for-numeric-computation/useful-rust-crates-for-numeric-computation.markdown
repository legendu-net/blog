## [num](https://crates.io/crates/num)
[num](https://crates.io/crates/num)
A collection of numeric types and traits for Rust, 
including bigint, complex, rational, range iterators, generic integers, and more!

## [num-derive](https://crates.io/crates/num-derive)
[num-derive](https://crates.io/crates/num-derive)
providess procedural macros to derive numeric traits in Rust.

## [num-traits](https://crates.io/crates/num-traits)
[num-traits](https://crates.io/crates/num-traits)
provides numeric traits for generic mathematics in Rust.

## [enum_primitive](https://crates.io/crates/enum_primitive)
[enum_primitive](https://crates.io/crates/enum_primitive)
is a macro to generate `num::FromPrimitive` instances for enum that works in Rust 1.0+.

## [rust_decimal](https://crates.io/crates/rust_decimal)
[rust_decimal](https://crates.io/crates/rust_decimal)
is a decimal number implementation written in pure Rust suitable 
for financial calculations that require significant integral 
and fractional digits with no round-off errors.

## [nalgebra](https://crates.io/crates/nalgebra)
[nalgebra](https://crates.io/crates/nalgebra)
is a general-purpose linear algebra library with transformations 
and statically-sized or dynamically-sized matrices.

## [ndarray](https://crates.io/crates/ndarray)
[ndarray](https://crates.io/crates/ndarray)
is an n-dimensional array for general elements and for numerics. 
Lightweight array views and slicing; views support chunking and splitting.

https://crates.io/crates/arrayfire
ArrayFire is a high performance software library for parallel computing with an easy-to-use API. Its array based function set makes parallel programming simple. ArrayFire's multiple backends (CUDA, OpenCL and native CPU) make it platform independent and highly portable. A few lines of code in ArrayFire can replace dozens of lines of parallel computing code, saving you valuable time and lowering development costs. This crate provides Rust bindings for ArrayFire library.
