[Earthly](https://github.com/earthly/earthly)
is a versatile, approachable CI/CD framework that runs every pipeline inside containers, 
giving you repeatable builds that you write once and run anywhere. 
It has a super simple, instantly recognizable syntax that is easy to write and understand – like Dockerfile and Makefile had a baby. 
And it leverages and augments popular build tools instead of replacing them, so you don’t have to rewrite all your builds no matter what languages you use.
