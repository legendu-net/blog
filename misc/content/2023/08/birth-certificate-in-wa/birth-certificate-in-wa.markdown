## Order a Birth Certificate

1. It is suggested that you order by mail if it is not urgent.
    Otherwise, 
    it is suggested that you order online and use "UPS Next Day" delivery.

2. order as soon as possible as some info on the birth certificate might be incorrect
    and it takes time to change info on the birth certificate.

## Chaning Birth Certificate

1. expedite service: "Attention: Amendment Supervisor"

2. Send the original copy together with the "Affidavit for Correction" form 
    to get a corrected copy of birth certificate.
    You can also send the original copy later to get a corrected copy.

    if they can help.
