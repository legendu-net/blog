**Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author. Please read with your own judgement!**

1. Choose the right size of car to rent.

2. Be as specific as possible on your rental requirement. 

3. People at the front desk won't tell you all details about the rental car.
    Instead,
    they often tell you the maker and mode of the car.
    If you are not familar about the make/mode of the car,
    be sure to verify details.

    - Is it a sedan, SUV, pickup or other types of vehicle?
    - Does it have CarPlay?
    - How many people can it hold?
    - How many luggage can it hold?
    - Is a baby seat included (if you reqested one).

3. Some car rental companies provides baby seat.
