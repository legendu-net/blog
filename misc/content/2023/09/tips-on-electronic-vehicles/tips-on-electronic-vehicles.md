## Battery

The battery of an EV typically lasts for 8 years.

## Charging

1. It is safe to charge in an open charging station when it is raining. 
    However, 
    avoid charing in an open charging station hen it rains really heavily. 

2. While an EV is been charging,
    pressing the start button allow you to use radio, climate control and infotainment.
    However,
    you cannot drive the EV while it's being charged. 
    Press the start button again without pushing the brake pedal turns the EV off.

## Bi-directional Charger

The idea is pretty cool. 
But how do you easily use it? 

- have go invest a lot to purchase a bidirectional charger and install it
- do I have to constantly switch the main broker on and off? If not then convenient, otherwise, a pain in the ass
- convenient if there's a power outage
