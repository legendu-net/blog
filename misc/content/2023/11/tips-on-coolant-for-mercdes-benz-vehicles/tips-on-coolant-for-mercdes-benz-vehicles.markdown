Note: Mercedes-Benz dealships might provide free coolant top off as a courtsy service.
You'd better call the service department of your Mercedes-Benz dealship to confirm this 
before you purchase coolant and top off it by yourself.

## Tips 

1. After April of 2014,
    Mercedes-Benz started using the pink-violet MB 325.5 or MB 325.6 coolant specification. 
    If in doubt,
    call the parts department of your Mercedes-Benz dealshiper for help.
    MB 325.5 or MB 325.6 coolant can be purchased 
    from a local Mercedes-Benz dealership 
    or 
    [online](https://www.mbpartscenter.com/oem-parts/mercedes-benz-mb-325-6-g40-anti-freeze-1-gallon-1-gal-9896807090109)
    .

2. MB 325.5 and MB 325.6 coolant typically last for 15 years or 150,000 miles
    before a flush is needed.

2. MB 325.5 and MB 325.6 coolant need to be diluted 1:1 using distilled water.
    However, 
    it is OK to top off a little MB 325.5 or MB 325.6 into the coolant tank 
    without dilution.
    If in emergency,
    you can also top off tap water into the coolant tank
    and drive to a Mercdes-Benz dealership for help.
