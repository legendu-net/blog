Note: Mercedes-Benz dealships might provide free coolant top off as a courtsy service.
You'd better call the service department of your Mercedes-Benz dealship to confirm this 
before you purchase coolant and top off it by yourself.

After April of 2014,
Mercedes-Benz started using the pink-violet MB 325.5 / MB 325.6 coolant specification. 
If in doubt,
call the parts department of your Mercedes-Benz dealshiper for help.
MB 325.6 coolant can be purchased from a local Mercedes-Benz dealership or online.
