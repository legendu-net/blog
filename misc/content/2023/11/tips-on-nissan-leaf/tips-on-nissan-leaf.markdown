**Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author. Please read with your own judgement!**

1. As many other vehicles, Nissan Leaf has Hill Start Assistant.
    While Hill Start Assistant is helpful,
    it auto applies break only for 2 seconds after you release the break and before you apply the acceleration pedal.
    This can be dangerous if you release the break early on a hill.
    For safety,
    it is recommended that you
    - Do not release the break unless the traffic in front of you moves forward.
    - Always apply the parking brake whenever the vehicle fully stops. 
        This adds extra safety in addition to the Hill Start Assistant.

2. Turn on climate control in the morning to warm the car.
