## General Tips

1. [在美国退休前必做这5件事，90%的人不知道这些窍门](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUbMAU47St8)

2. You can contribute to your own IRA accounts 
    even if you have maxed out your 401K contributions.
    For people without coverage of work 401K plans and low income,
    those contributions are tax deductable.
    For people with coverage of work 401K plans or relative high income,
    those contributions are not tax deductable.
    Please refer to [Retirement topics - IRA contribution limits](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-ira-contribution-limits)
    for detailed information on IRA contribution limits and tax deductable qualifications.
    Even you are not qualified for tax deduction on IRA contributions,
    it can still be beneficial to contribute 
    as some brokerages (e.g., Robinhood and Webull) do matches on IRA contributions.

## Roth 401K vs Pre-tax 401K

BEST time to contribute to a roth 401k is 
when you are helping pay for a child's college, and you are getting tax credits.  
This generally results in an extremely low effective tax rate.

## Rollover 401K

1. You can rollover your 401K/IRA accounts to the same or a different financial institution.

2. Self-direct IRA accounts are (usually) free,
    however,
    managed IRA accounts for automated investments
    do have fees.
