- US Treasury Bonds (long-term)
- Treasury Notes (middle-term)
- Treasury Bills (T-Bills) (short-term)
- Treasury TIPS
- US Treasury Savings Bonds 
    - EE Bonds
    - I Bonds (Inflation-linked Bonds)

It is suggested that you invest in ETF or Money Market Fund alternatives 
instead of treasury securities directly
as ETF and Money Market Fund provides better liquidity.
