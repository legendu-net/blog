1. Index funds, ETFs and mutual funds are some popular ways of diversified investment.
    A mutual fund is actively managed (by a portfolio manager)
    while an index fund or ETF is passive managed.

2. Generally speaking,
    index funds and ETFs have lower expense ratios than mutual funds
    and thus are preferred to mutual funds.

3. ETFs can be traded any time during open market hours 
    while index funds and mutual funds are traded only once per day,
    which means that ETFs have higher lidiquity and thus is preferred.

4. Index funds are popular for retirement accounts.

## Money Market Funds

A money market fund is a special class of mutual funds 
which is designed to offer stability of capital, liquidity, and income.
Money market funds usually have relatively low expense ratio compared to other types of mutual funds.
However,
there are ETF alternatives (possibly with higher risk) to money market funds.
