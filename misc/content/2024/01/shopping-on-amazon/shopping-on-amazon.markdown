How to view Promotional Credit balance?

Amazon promotion credit is not shown directly.
You have to add an item sold by Amazon, 
proceed to checkout (but do not place the order)
and look for "P&G Promo Credit" in order summary.
If "Total before tax" is $0.00, 
it means that there might be more promotion credit left. 
You can increase the quantity of the item until "Total before tax" is positive,
then "P&G Promo Credit" in order summary shows the total promotion credit you have.
