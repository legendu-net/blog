## Cash Sweep Program

Charles Schwab has a bank sweep feature and this is automatically set up on your account, and allows your account to earn interest on any cash balance.
Yes, you can view that online by clicking on Accounts at the top of the website and then Balances in the drop down.
  
Once on that page, under Balance Details there will be a link for Rates next to Cash Balance.


## Money Market Funds

We do offer purchased money market funds. 
We do not offer sweep money market funds, 
so you would have to trade into and out of them.
You can view available funds by clicking on Products at the top of the website and then Money Market Funds in the drop down.
