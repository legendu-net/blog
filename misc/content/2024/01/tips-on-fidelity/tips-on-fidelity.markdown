1. Fidelity is a good choice for managing retirement accounts.

## Cash Sweep Program

1. Fidelity has cash sweep programs,
    which is supported by the concept of "core position".
    Core position is the default investment that uninvested money will be automatically moved to.

2. The default "core position" is FDRXX.
    You can change your core position 
    by clicking on it under your positions tab. 
    It will then give you the option to change it.
    You can find FDIC insured rates at
    [Fidelity® Cash Management Account](https://digital.fidelity.com/prgw/digital/fdic-interest-rate/fcma)
    .
