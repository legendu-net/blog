## Some Tips on Tax Consequences of Wash Sales

1. Avoid buying the same stock / security in Dec and Jan (next year).

2. Try to make each sale profitable by carefully choosing which lots of shares to sell.
    This is (partially) possible with some trading APIs (e.g., IB)
    but is not universally implemented
    (e.g., Alpaca API does not support it yet)
    .

3. To make tax calculations easier (in quant trading),
    try to buy and sell the same quantity of the same symbol.
