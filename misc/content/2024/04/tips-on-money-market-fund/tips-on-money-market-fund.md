- Orders can be placed to either buy or sell and can be made through a brokerage, advisor, or directly through the mutual fund.
- The shares of mutual funds are very liquid, easily traded, and can be bought or sold on any day the market is open.
- An order will be executed at the next available net asset value (NAV), which is determined after the market close each trading day.
- When thinking about price, investors need to take into account the fees and sales loads associated with funds.
