## Troubleshooting 

If your desk will move downwards, lower it to the lowest possible position.
Next, hold the down button on your keypad for 30 seconds without letting go. Then release.

(Please time yourself as the reset will not work if this 30 seconds is interrupted. You may see ASR or RESET flash on your keypad.)


Hold the down button again until the desk lowers slightly, then rises slightly at which point you can release the button. If the desk doesnâ€™t move, try again. Once this slight movement is achieved, the reset is complete and the desk should be functioning.
