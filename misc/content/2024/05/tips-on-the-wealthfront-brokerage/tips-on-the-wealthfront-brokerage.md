**Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author. Please read with your own judgement!**

WealthFront is good for long-term investment.
The stock account is not flexible. 
It allow you to specify amount of money to investment in certain stocks only.
However, 
it does not allow you to set orders to trade stocks, ETFs, etc.
