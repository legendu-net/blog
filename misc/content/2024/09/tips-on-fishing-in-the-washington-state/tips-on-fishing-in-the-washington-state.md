## Report Puget Sound Dungeness Catches

1. When looking up for your recreational account in the WDFW system,
    it's better to use WILD ID (rather than SSN or Driver's License).
    The reason is that SSN or Driver's License is not required for people under 15 
    when purchasing fishing licenses 
    and thus might not be available in the system
    while a WILD ID is always created in the system when a fishing license is sold.
    The WILD ID can be found on your fishing license.
