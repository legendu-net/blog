**Things on this page are fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author. Please read with your own judgement!**

## Fees 

### Utilities

1. Which utilities are included in the rent? Water, electric, trash, etc.

2. administration fee, application fee? I hate these fees.

2. Facing which direction?

- South is probably the best, especially the sun room

    
3. Internet

    - everyone claims their internet speed is fast
    - TV cable is usually faster than phone cable
    - ask for the name of internet supplier
    - Century Link is very bad, slow, limited services
    - Time Warner Cable is bad

## Facilities

- Garage (In states where the winter is long and fierce, it is better get a garage.)

- Laundry (Some apartments do not have a laundry room which is not convenient.)

- Gym

- Trash (get clear about where the trash can is and how to dispose trash)

- sink (make sure it works, try it!, some sink might be clogged)

- disposal (make sure there is disposal in the kitchen, some kitchen especially in cities don't have one)

## Floor

- Generally higher floor is more quiet
- higher floor is safer (security, flood, etc) and ususally cleaner (less bugs, etc.)

## Safety

1. Gated Community or Not

    - Gated is safer though not convenient for driving


## Location

### Quiet or Not

- too close to noisy road?

- too close to airport?

- too close to a pulic facility?

- big apartment? smaller is usually more quiet

- higher level is usually more quiet

1. Is the house in or close to woods? If so, there might be many bugs especially in southern states.

2. If a house/apartment is too close to a highway/subway, 
    it might be too noisy.
    From my experience, 
    two blocks (vertical distance) from the subway is acceptable.

3. Close to restaurant, shoppings, gym or not

4. How old is the apartment?
