Sometimes, 
a PDF file is corrupted or encrypted making it hard to extract data from it directly.
In this case,
you can convert a PDF page to an image first
and then use AI tools 
(e.g., [Table Image to CSV Converter](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-AiT7svnDN-table-image-to-csv-converter))
to extract data from it.
