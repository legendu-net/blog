## Wheel Realignment

1. It's a good idea to have your wheel alignment checked at least annually.
    Many professionals recommend checking it every 10,000 to 15,000 miles.

2. You definitely want to do wheel realignment in the following situations.
    - After significant impacts: Hitting potholes, curbs, 
        or being in an accident can knock your wheels out of alignment.
    - When you get new tires: A new set of tires is an excellent time to ensure proper alignment, 
        as it maximizes their lifespan.
    - If you notice symptoms: If your vehicle pulls to one side, 
        your steering wheel is off-center, 
        or your tires are wearing unevenly, get an alignment immediately.

3. Many car dealers have quick scanners at entrances of their service departments
    to detect wheel misalignment issues.
    However,
    be aware that the results of those quick scanners might not be accurate.
    To be sure, 
    try driving your car multiple times (with a constant speed) at multiple entrance 
    to see whether you get the same results.

## Transmission

1. EVs typically use a single-speed gearbox (transmission) 
    which is much simpler than traditional multi-speed transmissions of gasoline-powered cars.

2. It seems that people don't recommend to do transmission flush.

## Coolant

1. Do not mix different coolant together.

## Car Wash

1. You can save $1 by fueling your car and washing it together. 
    You will get a car wash code on the receipt if you fueling your car first, 
    which you can use to wash your car.
    So be sure to get a receipt. 
    If you want to wash your car without fueling your car,
    you can also pay inside the washing factory using credit card.
