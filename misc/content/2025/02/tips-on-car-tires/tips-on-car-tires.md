## Run-flat Tires 

1. Run-flat tires can be a good option 
    if you need the peace of mind 
    of being able to drive a short distance 
    after a puncture in a remote area where access to tire repair might be limited.

2. Run-flat tires does not performance as well 
    compared to standard (non-run-flat) tires on snow and ice.


## Snow Tires 

1. Snow tires are great for driving on snow and ice.
    However,
    you have to swap snow tires to all-season (or summer) tires 
    and store snow tires by yourself
    after the winter is over.
    Notice that different cars might have different sizes of tires.
    If you won't keep cars with the same size of tires for at least serveral years,
    your snow tires won't be well utilized.

2. If you do not want to go with snow tires 
    but still want good performance on snow and ice,
    you can choose the following tires (ranked according to preference).
    - All-weather tires.
    - All-season tires rated 3PMS (Three-peak Mountain Snow)
        which have good performance on medium snow.
        For example,
        Michelin CrossClimate is an all-season tire rated 3PMS.
    - All-season tires with the feature "M+S" 
        (means mud and snow)
        which has good performs in light snow.
        For example,
        BFGoodrich Advantage Control is such an example 
        (which is also relatively cheap compared to other famous brand tires)
        .
