Rstudio is the best cross-platform IDE for R so far. 
It is a lot like the IDE of MATLAB.
Once I came across the problem that Rstudio did not start. 
I search website for a solution but has no luck. 
I have seen broken configuration files prevent applications 
from working correctly a lot.
So I tried removing the configuration directory ".rstudio-desktop" from my home directory, 
and Rstudio worked properly again!
This trick also works for many other applications, 
e.g., forefix, latex (temporary files), etc.
