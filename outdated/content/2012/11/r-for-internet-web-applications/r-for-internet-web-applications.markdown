## Sending/Receiving Emails

1. There are many ways to send email in R.
    First, you can use `sendmail{sendmailR}`.
    The following code is a simple test email.

        sendmail(from="firedragon.du@gmail.com",
        to="dclong@iastate.edu",
        subject="Sending Email from R",msg="It works",
        control=list(smtpServer="mailhub.iastate.edu"))

    In this way, you can attach objects in R directly to the email,
    but it does not support email authentication,
    and it does not support multiple recipients very well.
    Second, you can call code written in other languages in R to send emails.
    For example,
    you can use `rJava` to call Java code to send emails in R.
    I have written an R package [dclong.jmail](https://github.com/dclong/dclong.spt)
    based on Java Mail API
    which can be used to send/receive emails.
    It supports email authentication.
    Another way is to use `system` or `shell`
    to call executable applications to send emails.
    There are many such email applications in Linux system.
    For Windows system,
    the application `sendEmail` written by Brandon zehm is good one,
    which support Gmail, multiple recipients and multiple attachments.
