1. Sometimes you might find that you can use some built-in function in
MATLAB at first, but later you cannot use it any. If so, you should
probably check whether you are doing parallel computing in MATLAB.
Parallel computing in MATLAB can cause some problem. What you can do
is to use other functions that MATLAB accept in parallel computing
to replace these which result in problems.

5. `dlmwrite` is convenient to write vector and matrix data to a file,
but it might lose accuracy especially when you do not specify the
accuracy attribute. So do not use `dlmwrite` to write data into text
files when you works with high accuracy data, instead, you can use
binary data.

6. `+` has priority over `:` in MATLAB which is different from R.

7. When MATLAB starts, it set the random number generator to the
default one and set the seed to be the default seed. So if you run a
simulation, reboot MATLAB and run the same simulation, you will get
the same results.

1. Since most arithmetic objects in MATLAB are matrices, arithmetic
operations in MATLAB are basically matric operations. So `+`, `-`,
`\*`, `/` are matrix addition operator, matrix subtraction
operator, matrix multiplication operator and matrix division
operator respectively. 
Notice that `/` is also called right matrix division operator. Suppose
`B/A=X`, it means that `XA=B`. There is also another matrix division
operator $\backslash$. Suppose $B\backslash A=X$, it means that
`AX=B`.
If you want to perform element wise
operation rather than matrix operations, you have to put
an extra dot (i.e. `.`) before the corresponding matrix
operators.
