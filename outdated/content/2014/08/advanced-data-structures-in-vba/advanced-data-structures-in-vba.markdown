## Dictionary/Hashtable

1. Set a reference to MS Scripting runtime

        Set dict = CreateObject("Scripting.Dictionary")

or

        Dim dict As New Scripting.Dictionary 

2. Example of use:

        If Not dict.Exists(key) Then 
            dict.Add key, value
        End If 

3. Don't forget to set the dictionary to Nothing when you have finished using it.

        Set dict = Nothing 

## Your Own Data Structure

You can define your own type in VBA.

        Dim numbers = New Integer() {1, 2, 4, 8}
        Dim doubles = {1.5, 2, 9.9, 18}

        Dim myarray As Variant
        myarray = Array("Cat", "Dog", "Rabbit")
