1. Install AeroFS server and store your stuff on Amazon S3

4. 32 bit version has problems on Debian and LMDE but seems to work well on Ubuntu.

5. Too slow currently, slow to detect changes ..., slow to find peers ...
    not a good solutions to use currently

## Questions

1. The icon of AeroFS doesn't show up in Ubuntu?

2. It seems that AeroFS is not fast?

3. Do you think it's necessary to install the server? ...
    It sounds to me that AeroFS is still too young

4. aerofs doesn't work any more on 32 bit debian, I guess it's probably because of 32 bit ...

3. Can I use multiple servers pointing to Amazon S3?
