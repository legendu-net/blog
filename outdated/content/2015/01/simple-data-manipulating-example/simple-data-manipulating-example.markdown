Suppose there is a data `s` in SAS containing a variable `x`.

    x
    3
    3
    4
    5
    2
    3
    9
    7
    1
    100
    3
    5
    0

Now we want to create another variable `y` such that

    y = 3 if x =3
    y = B_2 y + 2, o.w.


This is very hard to using the data step in SAS 
while very easy to do in R or the SAS IML procedure.
