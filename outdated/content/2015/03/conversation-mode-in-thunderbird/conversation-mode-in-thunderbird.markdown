There is a Thunderbird add-on `Conversation` 
which enables you read emails in the Gmail-like conversation mode.
However, 
it has some limitations. 
For example, many shortcuts do not work if you use the `Conversation` add-on.
Actually, thunderbird has a built-in conversation mode.
To enable the built-in conversation mode,
you need to popup the menu,
select `View` -> `Sort by`,
and check both `Date` and `Threaded`.
The makes emails in a folder shown in the conversation mode. 
However, it does not help much if you do not all emails in one folder 
(e.g., you probably don't have the sent emails in the Inbox folder).
You cannot of course setup Thunderbird to put all emails in the Inbox folder,
however,
there is a universal and more useful way to read emails in conversation mode.
You can open an email (and all other emails in the same conversation) in conversation mode, 
following the instructions below.

1. Right click on the message. 
3. Select `Open Message in Conversation` in the popup menu.

An even quicker way is to use the shortcut "CTRL + SHIFT + O" after selecting the message.
