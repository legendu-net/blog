## FiltaQuilla

Header Regex Match

This matches any available property of the message header database with a regular expression. 
(Once again, if you don’t know what a regular expression is, this is not for you.) 
The format of the text in the search is PROPERTY:REGEX (that is, delimited with a ‘:’ character). 
The property is one of the available properties 
that are set on the nsIMsgDBHdr object associated with the message. 
OK, you probably don't know what those are, but some common values are:

"subject",  "sender",  "message-id",  "references", "recipients", "date",  "size", "flags", "priority",
"label" (obsolete TB 1.5 term),  "statusOfset" (yes it is really spelled that way),  "ccList", "bccList",
"msgThreadId",  "threadFlags",  "threadId", "threadSubject", "msgCharSet",  "threadParent",
"junkscore" (either null, 0, or 100), "junkpercent", "junkscoreorigin",  "threadNewestMsgDate",
"msgOffset",  "offlineMsgSize".
