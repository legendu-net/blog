you can use the function dcreate to create a directory in sas
sas: created don't use "~" in the path, can cause problems
```SAS
x mkdir path;
```

```SAS
new-directory=DCREATE(dir-name<,parent-dir>);
```
too stupid, cannot use dcreate(...); must assigned the return results to another variable.
This applies to other function/calls in sas ...
x mkdir ...; in much more convenient to create directory in sas
dcreate does not recognize "~" while the unix/linux command way can recognize it!!!
