[RMarkdown Reference](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf)

1. The `rmarkdown` package is preferred to the `markdown` package.
There is also a small bug with the `markdown` package. 
`markdown::markdownToHTML` does not render markdown title of the format `##Title` correct.
A space is required after `#` for `markdownToHTML` to work.
However, 
`rmarkdown::render` works well on both situations. 

2. There are several ways to pass values between the R workspace and R Markdown.
One way is to use global variables (from the R workspace) in R Markdown directly.
However, 
you have to tell R Markdown the right working environment using the option `envir = 0`.
Without this, 
R Markdown uses the current working environment 
which might not be the global working environment
(e.g., when `knit` is called inside a function). 
Sometimes, 
it is more convenient to substitute patterns in R Markdown with required values directly.
Make sure to use unique patterns if you do it in this.
For example, 
if you want to pass a variable `site` by substituting into R Markdown,
a good way is to replace pattern `${site}` (instead of plain `site`) with the value of the variable `site`.

3. Avoid doing complicated calculations in RMakrdown. 
Separted the code for calculation, etc., and use rmakrdown for reporting purpose mostly ...,

4. `plotly` (for graphics) and `DT` (for tables) are great visualization tools to use with R Markdown.
