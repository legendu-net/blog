__PLUGINS NOTE__

Starting with version 4.5, Pelican moved to a new plugin structure utilizing namespace packages that can be easily installed via Pip. Plugins supporting this structure will install under the namespace package pelican.plugins and can be automatically discovered by Pelican. To see a list of Pip-installed namespace plugins that are active in your environment, run:

```
pelican-plugins

The list of necessary plugins is now in the `requirements.txt` file, and enabled in `PLUGINS` variable in `pelicanconf.py`
