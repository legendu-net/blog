1. Folders on the desktop (mapped to home directory) cannot be openned by double clicking. 
Not sure whether this is a bug of which file manager.

2. How to set up static ip in debian? 
I followed tutorials on line but had no luck. 
I'm not sure whether it's because of the version of debian that 
I used was sid. 

3. some program creates a directory "Documents" in my home directory. 
I have disabled XDG to do this. 
How do I know which program does this? And how can I disable it?
Mendeley

5. meanings of wheezy-updates and wheezy/updates (for security)?
