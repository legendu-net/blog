1. firefox-bin uses too much cpu, why? which plugin causes the problem? 
I have already disabled the flash player plugin.

2. firefox update, cannot connect to server, how to solve this problem, disable update?

3. firefox new tab page does not show tabs correctly on Linux Mint,
only 1 * 4 tabs are displayed ...
