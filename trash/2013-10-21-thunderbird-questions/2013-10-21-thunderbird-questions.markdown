1. how to disable notification for one account?
    It seems that you either have to disable notification for all accounts 
    or to disable notification for none of them.

3. it seems to me that the "Send Later" extension isn't working right? (12/21/2013)

10. what the best way to import/export email filters?

1. it seems that duchuanlong@gmail.com is not syncing correctly
    and mostly china-lianyi emails.

2. how to sync chat history?

1. it seems that imap email sync has problems now!!!?

4. Thunderbird is slow very often, see how you can make it faster
    I think using tags to filter emails is much faster than search directly, of course!!!!

5. Thunderbird duchuanlong@gmail.com filter doesn't work any more.
    The filter file is there but not shown.

6. Any plugin to insert contact information directly?
    This can be very useful! Write one if there's no existing one.

7. You universal contact software. Is it better to connect it with Thunderbird?

8. strange, I've moved it a new place but it still places mails in the old place 
    fix the problem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

9. lightning calendar, which online calendars can be synced?
    - Google calendar

11. selective sync using symbolic links, linfig.thunderbird
    or write a sync script by yourself

12. Can I hide an account or hide the number of messages in an account?
    The reason is that one of account is for non-important messages. 
    I do not check daily and want to disturbed by the unread message number alert.

1. is it possible to adjust the font size in Windows? 
    It is a little bit small for me.

2. How to let tags show number of (unread) emails related to it?
