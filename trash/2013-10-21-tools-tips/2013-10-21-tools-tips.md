1. using symbolic links in dropbox folder is problematic:
    1. the symbolic links get synced as real files/directories on other computers
    2. It might have problem if you push things to a repository and give the symbolic link to public for downloading. Strickly speaking, this is a problem of using symbolic with GIT not with Dropbox.
