**
Things on this page are 
fragmentary and immature notes/thoughts of the author.
It is not meant to readers 
but rather for convenient reference of the author and future improvement.
**


1. It is very hard to finish all questions,
so you should do questions as fast as you can.
Do not waste too much time on a problem even if you know how to solve it.

2. You are not good at vocabulary, 
so just skip these questions if you cannot come up with a answer immediately.

3. Most calculation problems do not need a calculator.
Do it in a smart way. 
For example, get a range of the numbers.

4. Be careful whether it asks for a numeric answer or a English-written answer.

5. Sequences problems are either arithmetic or geometric.

6. Problems ask for average.

7. Problems asking for current day of the week.
I suggest you use numbers to do the calculation.
1 - 7 correspond to Mon - Sunday.
count number of before/after
pay attention to yesterday/tomorrow

8. Problems asking for current month of the year.

9. Problems about the smallest number. 
As small as possible after the decimal point. 
Sometimes involves fractions. 
Compare them to 1/10, etc.

10. Arrange words to be a sentence.
