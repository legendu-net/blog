1. bufferheight mode? bug?

2. a better dircolors scheme for CygwinPortable?

5. How to let ls (Cygwin) ignore hidden files in Windows?
You probably need to alias ls to a customized one

4. I cannot get crontab to work on Cygwin, not sure what has caused the problem

1. in cygwin, executable file, e.g., excel, etc. cannot change permission -x?

2. you updated apt-cyg's mirror site, but even so it's still not usable ...
