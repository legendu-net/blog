I used to rely on bash a lot, 
but there are more advanced tools for managing cluster of servers.

1. Ansible

1. ClusterSSH 

2. `Fabric` (Fabric3 for Python3) is a Python package 
which allows you to write simple pythonic script to manage cluster of servers.
Ansible is a better alternative to `Fabric`.
